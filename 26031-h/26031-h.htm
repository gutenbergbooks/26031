<p>In perusing the following Memoir, the reader must not be surprised if
he finds that the accounts of the several battles in which the
illustrious Saumarez was engaged, differ in some degree from those
previously given to the public. Every circumstance connected with them
has been carefully examined, and whatever statements are now advanced
can be borne out by documentary evidence. The career of Saumarez was a
long and eventful one: he entered the Navy while the nation was at
peace; he subsequently served during the American War of
independence, and throughout the late continental war, in both of
which he was in more engagements with the enemy than any other
officer. He was the last of the heroes of the 12th of April 1782.</p>

<p class="blockquote"></p>
<p>Genealogy of the family of Saumarez.&mdash;Curious Record.&mdash;Branches of the late
family.&mdash;Marriage of the late Lord de Saumarez.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p>Admiral the Right Honourable James Lord de Saumarez, of Guernsey, was
born, on the 11th March 1757, in the parish of St. Peter-Port, the
principal town of that romantic island. The family, whose original
name was <span class="italic">De Sausmarez</span>, is of Norman extraction, and of great
antiquity in the island of Guernsey, where their lineage can be traced
almost to the Norman conquest.</p>

<p>Their remote ancestor received from the Dukes of Normandy a fief of
the district of Jerbourg, and was appointed hereditary captain (or
chatelain) of the castle of that name, which lies within the limits of
the fief, and is situated in the parish of St. Martin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the records of the island, we find the following interesting
particulars:&mdash;In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Edward the
First, at a court of chief pleas held at Guernsey, in the presence of
the judges of assize, Matthew de Sausmarez made homage for his fief;
which appears to have been acknowledged by an act of Edward the Second
in the year 1313: and in the reign of Edward the Third, in the year
1331, an application was made by Matthew de Sausmarez for a
confirmation of his rights and prerogatives, as formerly enjoyed by
his ancestors.</p>

<p>On receipt of this petition, his Majesty sent an order to John de
Roches, guardian of the Channel islands, to make a perquisition
thereon; authorising him to give to it his royal assent if not found
to be prejudicial to the rights of the Crown or the privileges of the
inhabitants, who had, by consent of his Majesty's father, fortified
the castle of Jerbourg as a place of retreat and protection, as also
for the security of their effects in case of invasion by the enemy.</p>

<p>In pursuance of his Majesty's order, the guardian appointed twelve of
the most respectable inhabitants of the island to be examined before
the bailiff or chief magistrate, who declared upon oath that the
predecessors of Matthew de Sausmarez held that appointment from the
Crown, with sundry appurtenances and privileges, which, in
consideration of their services as hereditary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> keepers of the castle,
had always been, and ought to be, inseparable from the fief of
Jerbourg; and they further deposed, that these were not in any respect
detrimental to the prerogative of the Crown, or injurious to the
rights of the inhabitants, who still retained the advantage and
privilege of retreating into the castle, with their effects, in every
emergency.</p>

<p>The following curious and interesting fact, as attached to this
ancient fief, has been also recorded in a Guernsey periodical:
"Whenever the lord had occasion to go to Jersey, his tenants were
obliged to convey him thither, for which they received a gratuity of
<span class="italic">three sous</span>, or a dinner; but they were not obliged to bring him
back." And this exemption may be thus explained:&mdash;The lord, or captain
of Jerbourg, in those days held a fief in Jersey, called by the same
name, which no longer belongs to the De Saumarez family; but formerly,
when it was possessed by the same individual, the same rights and
privileges were attached, so that when the affairs of the lord called
him to Jersey, he was conducted to that island by his Guernsey
tenants, and brought back by those of Jersey.</p>

<p>It is indeed certain, that, during many years after the Norman
conquest, several gentlemen possessed estates in both islands, more or
less considerable in one than in the other. The fief of Jerbourg
remained in the family of De Sausmarez<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> till about the year 1555, when
it became the property of Mr. John Andros, in right of Judith de
Sausmarez: but it has since reverted to the descendants of the old
family, and belonged to Thomas de Sausmarez, his Majesty's late
attorney-general in the island of Guernsey, who died lately at a very
advanced age,&mdash;the father of twenty-eight children!</p>

<p>The genealogy of the family between the year 1481, and the birth of
the grandfather of the late Lord de Saumarez on the 4th June 1635,
will be found in the Addenda, as also that of the subsequent members
of the family who are not mentioned here; but, in proceeding, we
cannot pass over the names of Captains Philip and Thomas Saumarez,
uncles of the late lord, who were two of the bravest and most
meritorious officers of their time. The former, who was first
lieutenant with Commodore Anson, afterwards commanded the Nottingham,
sixty-four, captured the French seventy-four, Mars, and was killed in
action 1747;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the latter, when in command of the Antelope, of
fifty guns, captured the French sixty-four, Belliqueux, in the
following extraordinary manner:</p>

<p>In the month of November 1758, Captain Saumarez was stationed in the
Bristol Channel for the protection of the trade, and, the wind blowing
strong from the westward, had anchored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> his ship, the Antelope, of
fifty guns and three hundred and fifty men, in King Road; and there
being little probability of the appearance of an enemy under such
circumstances, he had repaired to Bristol to partake of the
hospitality of his friends in that prosperous city. While sitting at
dinner, an express came from Barnstaple to inform him that a large
ship, supposed to be an enemy, had anchored under Lundy Island.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez immediately repaired on board his ship, weighed
anchor, and, notwithstanding the contrary wind and fresh gale, he beat
down the channel, and in the morning saw her at anchor off Ilfracombe.
On discovering the Antelope, the enemy weighed and stood towards her,
and, on coming near, hoisted French colours and seemed prepared to
engage. As soon as the Antelope came within gun-shot, she opened her
fire, when the Frenchman immediately hauled down his colours without
returning a shot. Captain Saumarez now sent his boat with the first
lieutenant to know if she had surrendered; but finding that the boat
did not return, he bore down under her stern, and asked if they had
struck. The answer was in the affirmative, and she was immediately
taken possession of. She proved to be the Belliqueux, of sixty-four
guns and five hundred men.</p>

<p>When the captain came on board the Antelope, and found that he had
surrendered to a ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> so much inferior in force, both in men and
weight of metal, his chagrin and mortification knew no bounds. He
exclaimed that he had been deceived, and actually proposed to Captain
Saumarez that he should allow him to return to his ship, and that he
would fight him fairly; to which the English captain replied that he
must keep possession now; that he had obtained it, but he had no
objection to his going back to France and getting another ship of the
same kind to try the fortune of war. He conducted his prize back to
King Road, and returned to Bristol with his French guest to enjoy the
hospitality and hearty welcome of his friends, after an absence of
only eighteen hours!</p>

<p>Matthew de Saumarez, father of Lord de Saumarez, being brought up to
the medical profession, arrived at considerable practice and high
respectability. He was remarkable for his urbanity of manners and
hospitality, particularly to strangers. He married, first, Susannah,
daughter of Thomas Dumaresq, Esq. of Jersey, and by her had Susannah
(an only child), who married Henry Brock, Esq. of Guernsey: his second
wife was Carteret, daughter of James Le Marchant, Esq. of Guernsey,
and by her he had a numerous family, who are brothers and sisters of
the late lord.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The family of De Sausmarez, a branch of which changed the spelling of
the name to Saumarez about the year 1700, was not only one of the most
ancient and respectable, but the members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> of it successively held the
highest situations, and were connected with the first families
residing in the island of Guernsey, which has always been
distinguished for its loyalty and patriotism: indeed, it has not only
produced several of our bravest and greatest warriors, but its
inhabitants have ever manifested themselves to be proof against every
attempt to seduce them from their allegiance. The opinions which have
been entertained unfavourable to this fact,&mdash;arising no doubt from the
proximity of the island to the coast of France, and the general use of
the French language, but, most of all, from its having at one time
been infested by adventurers,&mdash;are totally without foundation.</p>

<p>Having been many years stationed at this island, we have witnessed the
loyalty and intrepidity of the natives: and could give several
instances where the Guernsey pilot was the <span class="italic">first</span> to board the enemy.</p>

<p>Lord de Saumarez was married at Guernsey, on the 27th October 1788, to
Martha, only daughter and heiress of Thomas Le Marchant, Esq. by
marriage with Miss Mary Dobr&eacute;e, two of the most ancient and
respectable families in the island. This marriage was the consequence
of a long and mutual attachment: it need scarcely be added, that it
completed the happiness of both. They became the parents of eight
children, whose biography will be found in the <ins title="See Volume Two">Appendix.</ins></p>

<p class="p2">
The illustrious admiral, of whose ancestors a biographical sketch has
been briefly given in the preceding chapter, and in the Addenda to
this work, and whose glorious career is the subject of this record,
passed from the first rudiments of learning, under a dame, to the more
manly tuition of Elizabeth College, in Guernsey, where his brother,
fifteen months his senior, was receiving his education.</p>

<p>Although he always said that his brother was a much better scholar in
both Latin and Greek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> than himself, his taste for poetry, and his
discrimination in that refined branch of literature, must have
appeared at a very early age, as, when he was only seven or eight
years old, he surprised his mother by reciting to her several lines
from the first pages of Milton's Paradise Lost, which he had learnt of
his own accord,&mdash;a foretaste of the gratification which he derived
through life in reading that noble poem. His mother was so delighted
with this unexpected discovery of his taste, that she could not
forbear making it known to her friends; especially to a literary
gentleman of her acquaintance, who sent young Saumarez a present of
the Golden Verses of Pythagoras, which he also committed to memory,
and retained throughout his life.</p>

<p>But the great sensibility of his heart was most apparent in his
attachment to all his relations: their pleasures and their pains were
always <span class="italic">his</span>; and it is therefore not surprising that he was a
favourite with them all. In those days, Guernsey was, as it were, a
large family; and the society of the upper classes was linked in a
small, but a select and happy, circle, interested in each other's
welfare. The communication with England not being, as now, kept up by
regular packets, the arrival of a stranger was an event of some
importance, and mostly occurred through the visits of the king's ships
going on foreign stations, which put into Guernsey for wines and
other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> stores: on these occasions the captains and officers were
constant guests at the hospitable mansion of our hero's father, and it
was usually the province of young Saumarez to look out for and report
their appearance.</p>

<p>In July 1767, this little community was surprised by an occurrence
which to this day is related among the events of "olden times," as
having made a great, and certainly a lasting impression. His royal
highness the Duke of Gloucester, on his return from a tour in France,
anchored in Guernsey roads. At two in the morning, the hostess of the
only inn in the town was awakened by a call that the Duke of
Gloucester had landed, and was coming there: not supposing this
possible, she for a long time refused to rise; but, being at length
convinced, she directed the party to the house of the
lieutenant-governor, who was as incredulous as the good woman of the
Ship Inn.</p>

<p>At last he appeared at the window in his dressing-gown and <span class="italic">bonnet de
nuit</span>, and finding whom he was called upon to receive, he exclaimed,
in the trepidation of the moment,&mdash;"My house is not fit for the duke;
go to my friend, Doctor Saumarez." There at last his royal highness
found entrance, and a hearty welcome; but it may be conjectured that
no little surprise and bustle spread through the house at the
unexpected arrival at such an hour of the illustrious guest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> The blue
damask room was, however, soon prepared, with other apartments for the
aides-de camp, Sir Henry Clinton and another.</p>

<p>Young Saumarez and his brother were sent off, as soon as the sun rose,
to inform their uncle the attorney-general, who resided some distance
from the town, that the royal visitor had arrived. On their return the
streets were decorated with crowns, festoons, and garlands of flowers,
which had risen as from the wand of a magician; the bells were
ringing, the populace were in holiday suits, and the whole effect was
so animated, that the more splendid scenes of after-life never erased
it from the mind of Saumarez.</p>

<p>The duke, on rising, was surprised at the quick display of loyalty he
beheld, and expressed himself much gratified at the proofs he received
of respect and attachment which these faithful islanders evinced in
his person towards the king and the royal family. His royal highness
condescended to honour a ball in the evening; and often did young
Saumarez hear his aunt (a sister of his mother, married to Major
Brabazon of the 65th regiment,) relate her having opened the ball in a
minuet with his royal highness.</p>

<p>Young Saumarez had long and constantly cherished a decided
predilection for the navy. Accustomed as he had been from childhood to
hear of the fame which his valiant uncles, Captains Philip and Thomas
Saumarez, had acquired, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> mind was early inspired with a desire to
tread in their path, and to acquire for himself a name which might
emulate theirs. His eldest brother was already in the navy; but his
father having six sons, when he found that James had evinced such a
desire for the sea, and having connexions in the service, probably
considered that he could not place another more advantageously than in
a profession which had already afforded an honourable and glorious
career to two of his family. Accordingly he accepted the offer of
Captain Lucius O'Bryen, of his majesty's ship Soleby, who entered his
name on the books of that ship on the 20th September 1767 as
volunteer, where it remained until the 3rd of June 1770, having been
there two years and nine months. During this time, however, he never
joined the ship, but was for a part of it at a school in the vicinity
of London, which had been recommended to his father by a naval friend,
who appears to have been ill qualified to make the selection, if we
may judge from the amusing account which Saumarez gave in after-life
of his acquirements in that seminary. Fortunately, as he said, when he
had been there ten months, his father being in London, sent for him,
and to his great joy took him home, and with this portion of education
he was launched into the world; as a few months after he went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> to
Portsmouth to join the Montreal, Captain Alms, who had been a friend
of his uncles, and who had visited his father at Guernsey.</p>

<p>On the 9th of August 1769, the ship sailed for the Mediterranean.
Great pains were taken by the captain to improve the talents of young
Saumarez, which soon became apparent: but the commodore being obliged
to return home on account of ill health, he placed him in the
Winchelsea; and we find that he went on board the Pembroke, bearing
the broad pendant of Commodore Proby, and commanded by Captain Durell,
who was a relative of the family, on the 14th August 1770, and joined
the former ship on the 28th September following.</p>

<p>Nature happily had endowed young Saumarez with talents, and qualities
of mind and heart, which in a great measure repaired the want of a
regular and more enlarged education: a sound judgment and quick
sensibility soon led him to perceive his deficiency in acquired
knowledge; and he was inspired with a laudable ambition, to remedy it
by every exertion the feeble means within his reach could accomplish.
When, indeed, it is considered that only a few volumes of the
Spectator and Idler, with some stray volumes of the Roman History,
composed his little library, it may justly be inferred that it was no
ordinary capacity or moderate application which could form a character
such as was manifested by him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Frigates, in those days, had neither chaplains nor schoolmasters; and
the "young gentlemen," when off duty, were left to spend their time as
they thought fit. The midshipmen of the present day can have but a
faint idea of the hardships and privations of a naval aspirant's life
at the period Saumarez entered the service. Biscuits with insects, and
tainted meat, was the usual fare when at sea at their mess-table; and
none would have thought of procuring such <span class="italic">luxuries</span> as are now
indispensable <span class="italic">necessaries</span> to their successors in the service. While
there is great cause to rejoice in the change which has taken place,
it should not prevent the expression of just and well-founded regret
that the amelioration has spread to the opposite extreme; the placing
a son in the navy being now a heavy tax instead of a relief, which we
know is felt severely by old naval officers on half-pay, who naturally
wish to employ a son in the service to which they belong.</p>

<p>With grateful remembrance, Saumarez has often been heard to say, that,
on his departure from home, his affectionate father put a purse
containing fifteen guineas in his hand; observing that, as he knew he
had a large family, he trusted that he would use it with economy, but
that when he wanted more he might draw on his banker. So strictly,
however, did he fulfil this recommendation, that his father said, the
sight of his drafts gave him pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>His first journal is of the Winchelsea, Captain Samuel Cranston
Goodall, and commences on the 8th November 1770, at which time he was
first rated a midshipman: he remained in that ship until the 14th
February 1772. During these seventeen months he gained a valuable
friend in Captain Goodall, whose regard he preserved to the end of his
life. Saumarez had constant access to his cabin: he allowed him to
write there, and make extracts from the best authors in his
possession, which was of great service in improving his acquaintance
with modern literature. This ship had been cruising in the
Mediterranean, and visited most of the interesting ports there; and,
in February 1772, the Winchelsea was ordered to England,&mdash;an account
joyfully hailed by all on board, but by none more sincerely than by
Mr. Saumarez, whose heart panted to see his dearest friends. What,
then, must have been his feelings, on the arrival of the Levant to
relieve the Winchelsea, when he was sent for by Captain Goodall, and
apprised that Captain Thompson would receive him?&mdash;and as it was of
importance that he should finish his time before going home, he
strongly recommended his stay, especially as it was his father's wish.
Although it was as if a sword had pierced his heart, he calmly
submitted to the decision, and he saw the worthy Captain Goodall and
his messmates depart without a murmur.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>This self-denial was not wholly unrewarded. The Levant was a larger
ship, affording much better accommodation to the midshipmen; and Mr.
Saumarez, having been nearly three years at sea, became of some
consequence with his messmates. The date of his joining the Levant was
the 15th February 1772, having been discharged on the preceding day
from the Winchelsea. He soon formed a close friendship with Mr. Samuel
Thompson, the captain's son; which continued unshaken till the death
of the latter in 1782.</p>

<p>The British merchants having petitioned for a ship of war to be
stationed in the Mediterranean for the protection of the trade, the
Levant was ordered on that service, and for fourteen months remained
in that inactive position, which young Saumarez used to say he
considered a blank in his existence. Having no books to relieve the
spirits, no letters to cheer the heart, life wasted away without
profit or satisfaction. There must, however, have been a few bright
days; for he often mentioned with pleasure the hospitality of the
English families settled in Smyrna, of which he occasionally partook
when Captain Thompson allowed it. This was the more frequent on
account of his thorough knowledge of the French language, which was
the means of procuring him attentions rendered doubly acceptable by
the dulness of that anchorage: such were the advantages he derived
from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> his familiarity with that language, that he never failed to
recommend the study of it to all his young <span class="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</span> before going to
sea.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May 1773, the Levant was at length released, and sailed
for Gibraltar; from which place she proceeded to Port Mahon, to be
repaired. On the 28th of May 1774, she resumed her old station in
Smyrna harbour, (in consequence of an insurrection, in which several
Christians had been massacred, owing to the destruction of the Russian
fleet in the Bay of Chisma, on the contiguous coast,) having been away
precisely one year. She again left that station, on the 19th of
September, for Gibraltar; and finally for England in March 1775, on
the 29th of which month she arrived at Spithead. On the 14th of the
following April, Mr. Saumarez was discharged from the Levant; and had
at length the long-wished-for happiness of seeing again his native
land, and the friends from whom he had been for more than five years
separated.</p>

<p>The Levant, being paid off, was recommissioned by the Honourable
Captain Murray, who used every persuasion to induce Mr. Saumarez to
remain in the ship; but, after an absence of five years, he was too
anxious to spend some time with his family, to accede to his proposal,
and the moment he was at liberty he set off for Guernsey.</p>

<p>Taking into account the time his name had been on the books of the
Solebay, he had now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> served more than the required six years of
service: and as the regulations for age were at that time not strictly
enforced, after a few weeks of rest he went to London to pass his
examination for lieutenant; but owing to the commissioners being on
their annual visits to the dock-yards, and their return being
protracted, two months elapsed before the object was accomplished.
This enabled him again to return to his friends, but he was not then
permitted long to enjoy their society.</p>

<p>In the year 1775, on the breaking out of the war with the American
colonies, Commodore Sir Peter Parker being appointed to the command of
a squadron, with his broad pendant on board the Bristol, of fifty
guns, Mr. Saumarez, then eighteen years of age, was ordered to join
that ship, through the recommendation of Admiral Keppel, who, having
been the friend and contemporary of his uncles, ever evinced an
interest in his advancement. After an interview with Sir Peter in
London, he embarked, on the 9th of October, at Sheerness, whence the
Bristol proceeded to the Nore at the end of November. After passing a
short time at Spithead and Plymouth, which they left on the 21st of
December, the squadron sailed for Cork, the last rendezvous of the
expedition destined for South Carolina. This consisted of six
frigates, two bombs, and two hundred transports, containing seven
regiments of infantry and two companies of artillery, under the
command of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> distinguished nobleman, the Earl Cornwallis, and the
Honourable Brigadier-general Vaughan. These two chiefs, with their
aides-de-camp, Lord Chewton and Captain Eustace, were embarked on
board the Bristol: they sailed about the middle of January 1776.</p>

<p>On the passage out, which was remarkable for stormy weather, and for
the consequent dispersion of the convoy, the activity and zeal of
young Saumarez not only attracted the attention, but gained the esteem
of the noble earl; who, by offering to make him his aide-de-camp and
take him by the hand, had nearly persuaded him to leave the naval
service, and enter the army, offering him a commission in the 33rd,
his own regiment. We have heard him relate, that, after he had more
than half consented, he went below and told his messmates, who
immediately jeered him so much about "turning soldier," that he
returned to the quarter-deck and gave a positive refusal to the earl,
who could not help expressing his disappointment and chagrin on the
occasion.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that he would have highly distinguished himself
in the army, or wherever he was placed; but, happily for the nation,
and for the honour of the profession which he had first chosen, he was
destined to display his bravery and splendid talents in a sphere where
there happened to be a much greater range for them, than if he had
followed the fortunes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> noble earl in the other honourable
service. Many years after, when Saumarez's career had proved the
wisdom of his decision, he met Lord Cornwallis at dinner at Lord
Spencer's, then first lord of the admiralty; who, on hearing this
anecdote, observed, "Lord Cornwallis would have deprived the naval
service of one of its best officers."</p>

<p>The Bristol arrived off Cape Fear early in May, where they found
General Clinton; and, having repaired their damages, reached
Charlestown in the beginning of June. The troops were landed on the
island, at a low, sandy spot, in the midst of a heavy surf, and the
guns of the Bristol and the Experiment were put on board the Harcourt
East-indiaman, to enable them to get over the bar.</p>

<p>One of the transports, called the Friendship, having been fitted as a
ship of war to be taken into the service, was commissioned by
Lieutenant Charles Hope, first of the Bristol, an excellent officer,
and he selected Sir James Barclay and Mr. Saumarez to be his officers;
but, after a few days, he prevailed on Captain Hope to allow him to
return to the Bristol, which he did only two days previously to the
attack on Fort Sullivan, which, after passing the bar, it became
necessary to silence and take possession of. This fortress was
considered the key of the harbour, and the fortifications of it were
constructed with great skill: the works being formed of cabbage-tree,
a kind of wood peculiarly calculated, by its porous and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> elastic
quality, to resist the effects of shot; and, from its not being liable
to splinter, the troops in the batteries were secured from what is
deemed one of the principal means of destruction; while the Bristol's
crew were fully exposed to the fatal effects of the enemy's fire. The
guns being taken on board on the 28th of June 1776, at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the
squadron began the attack by a furious and incessant cannonade, which
continued with little intermission until nine o'clock at night. Never
did British valour shine more conspicuously, nor did our ships in an
engagement of the same nature experience so serious an encounter: the
squadron could not approach within grape-shot of the enemy, and
therefore could not clear the batteries; and the spring of the
Bristol's cable being cut by the shot, she swung so as to get
dreadfully raked. Mr. Saumarez was employed in replacing this spring
three times in the Mercury's boat, assisted by the captain of that
transport.</p>

<p>The brave Captain Morris, after receiving a number of wounds, with a
noble constancy disdained to quit his duty; until, his arm being shot
off, he was carried below in a condition which did not afford any
probability of recovery. At one time, the quarter-deck of the Bristol
was cleared of every one except the commodore, who stood on the
poop-ladder alone; a spectacle of intrepidity and firmness which has
been seldom equalled, never exceeded. It is said, that Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Saumarez
seeing him in this situation, requested him to come down; when he
replied with a smile, "What! you want to get rid of me, do ye?" while
he well knew that the reverse was the fact.</p>

<p>The loss sustained by the squadron in general, and by the Bristol in
particular, in an action unexampled in point of duration, and in which
it was finally repulsed, was very great: she had alone one hundred and
eleven killed and wounded, including her gallant captain and several
other officers.</p>

<p>During this severe conflict, Mr. Saumarez had a very narrow escape: at
the moment he was pointing a gun on the lower-deck, of which he had
the command, a shot from the fort entered the port-hole, struck the
gun, and killed seven out of eight men who were stationed to work it.
Some time afterwards, being called on deck to execute certain orders
respecting the replacing the spring on the cable, he was standing
close to Mr. Darley, a midshipman, for whom he had the greatest
regard, when a shot took off the young man's head and covered Mr.
Saumarez with his blood.</p>

<p>Captain Morris, after being carried below, lingered contrary to
expectation, and hopes were formed that he would survive; when,
unfortunately, his attendant being overcome with sleep, it is supposed
the captain's bandages gave way, and, not having strength to awake
him, he was found in the morning bathed in his blood. His dissolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
becoming inevitable, one of the officers asked him if he had any
direction to give with respect to his family; to which he nobly
replied, "None! I leave them to the Providence of God, and the
generosity of my country," and soon after expired. This engagement
lasted thirteen hours: it was the first in which Mr. Saumarez had been
present; and, after the very many in which he was subsequently
engaged, he has been heard to declare it to have been one of the most
severe he ever witnessed. Captain Scott, of the Experiment, lost his
arm; and there were several death-vacancies for lieutenants.</p>

<p>Mr. Saumarez's conduct during the whole of this obstinate and bloody
contest was deemed so especially meritorious, that the commodore
expressed his highest approbation of it in the warmest and most
flattering terms, and soon after the battle he promoted him to the
rank of lieutenant. The following is a copy of his first acting
commission:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>"By Sir Peter Parker, Commander-in-chief of a squadron of his Majesty's ships to
be employed on a particular service.</p>

<p>"Whereas I think it necessary for the good of his Majesty's service to have an
Acting-lieutenant on board his Majesty's ship the Bristol, you are hereby
required and directed to take upon you the office of Acting-lieutenant of his
Majesty's ship <span class="smcap">Bristol</span> strictly charging and commanding all the officers and
company of the said ship to behave themselves jointly, and severally, in their
respective employments, with all due respect and obedience <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>unto you their said
<span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>; and you are likewise to observe and execute the <span class="smcap">General Printed
Instructions</span>, and such orders and directions as you shall from time to time
receive from your captain, or any other your superior officer, for his Majesty's
service.</p>

<p>"For which this shall be your Order. Dated on board his Majesty's ship Bristol,
in Five-fathom Hole, off Charlestown, the 11th day of July 1776.</p>
<p class="right smcap">P. Parker.</p>
<p>"To Mr. James Saumarez, hereby<br />
appointed to act as Lieutenant on<br />
board his Majesty's ship Bristol,<br />
until further orders.</p>
<p>"By command of the Commodore.</p>
<p class="right smcap">John Read."</p></div>

<p>In this ship Acting-lieutenant Saumarez remained until the 23rd
September; serving often with the army on shore, and on all occasions
taking a distinguished part. He was actively employed in the boats of
the Bristol on every landing that took place, from the first
disembarkation of the troops in Gravesend Bay, to the landing at
Rochelle from Frog's-neck. Lord Howe then commanded in person on this
expedition, and hoisted his flag in the Carysfort, the gallant Captain
Fanshawe. His lordship appointed Mr. Saumarez his aide-de-camp, and
selected him to convey General Clinton, commanding the troops, to the
vicinity of Rochelle, when he had the satisfaction of receiving the
thanks of his lordship for his zealous exertions. All the boats were
then ordered to join their respective ships off New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> York; an order,
it may be supposed, not unwelcome after an absence of several weeks,
during which officers and men had been subject to all the privations
consequent on such a service, sleeping in boats, and scarcely having
any change of clothing.</p>

<p>Saumarez was afterwards on duty up the North River, and had the honour
of conveying Lord Cornwallis and his staff on board his boat in the
first landing in the Jerseys; and on several occasions he was actively
useful to his lordship, who repeatedly acknowledged his services.
Being employed in the disembarkation of troops newly arrived, he
discovered that his brother's regiment, the twenty-third Welsh (now
Royal Welsh) Fusileers, was one of them; and soon after he had the
happiness of meeting him, who, on his part, was not less agreeably
surprised at the welcome and unexpected encounter.</p>

<p>Being at head-quarters when Fort Washington surrendered, the garrison,
consisting of two thousand seven hundred men, having laid down their
arms, Lieutenant Saumarez was the bearer of the tidings to the
Bristol; but they appeared so incredible, that it was some time before
Sir Peter Parker could be persuaded of their authenticity.</p>

<p>Rear-admiral Lord Shuldham, having on the 6th September, shifted his
flag to the Bristol, Lieutenant Saumarez followed his commander, who
then hoisted his broad pendant in the Chatham. He was therefore
removed by Lord Viscount Howe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> vice-admiral of the white, and
commander-in-chief of all his Majesty's ships and vessels in North
America, to the Chatham, as fifth lieutenant "for the time being." In
this situation Lieutenant Saumarez so often and so particularly
distinguished himself in the boats, and in command of the Lady Parker
schooner, tender to the Unicorn, Captain Ford, that, on the 17th
February 1778, he was appointed lieutenant commanding the Spitfire, a
schooner-rigged galley, by special direction of the
commander-in-chief, as will appear by the following order:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">By Commodore Hotham, on board the Preston.</p>
<p>"The Viscount Howe having directed that you shall command the Spitfire galley,
in the room of Lieutenant Scott; you are hereby directed to repair on board the
said galley, and take the command of her accordingly, using the utmost despatch
in preparing and fitting her for a passage to Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="right">"Given on board the Preston, off<br />

<span class="smcap">W. Hotham.</span></p>

appointed to command<br />
H.M. galley, the Spitfire.</p>
<p class="left25">"By command. <span class="smcap">Titus Lewis.</span>"</p></div>

<p>Our young hero, who had been far less actively employed than he wished, had now
obtained almost the height of his ambition,&mdash;in other words, a situation
where he could have an opportunity of displaying his talents and intrepidity. He
found his new vessel in the king's yard; and, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> taken charge from her
former commander, proceeded to fit out with surprising diligence. On the 23rd
February he received twenty-three seamen from the Preston; and on the 27th a
sergeant and eleven marines completed his complement of thirty-seven men,
including himself and the carpenter; when he immediately weighed and made sail.
It soon after blew a gale, but he succeeded in reaching the Brothers, where he
anchored, and found H.M.S. Sphinx, and some traders: the next morning he
weighed, and falling in with H.M.S. Falcon and convoy, they proceeded on their
voyage. On the 4th of March strong gales obliged the convoy to put into
Huntingdon Bay, where they were detained by stormy weather till the 13th of
March. On the 15th the convoy reached Oyster-pond Bay, and on the 16th anchored
off Fort Island, in company with the Eagle, Nonsuch, Apollo, Mermaid, Unicorn,
Ariel, Maidstone, Grampus, and Stromboli; and here their active operations
began. On the 28th of March an enemy's frigate was chased and run on shore in
the Narraganset Passage, when Lieutenant Saumarez, together with the boats of
the squadron, went to destroy her, she being protected by a battery on shore;
the Spitfire was anchored about four hundred yards from this battery in twelve
feet water, and, having got her long-bow gun to bear, engaged it while the boats
boarded and set fire to the frigate: this occupied more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> than an hour, during
which time the battery was silenced, but a brisk fire of musketry was kept up by
the rebels; and the service being performed, the galley was towed out with
little damage, five men being wounded: at nine she anchored in safety off
Newton's Point. Soon after this a gale came on; the galley drove towards the
rocks, and it was supposed she must be lost; but Lieutenant Saumarez cut his
cable, and by a masterly act of seamanship saved his vessel, and gained the
admiration of the whole squadron. During this period, Lieutenant Saumarez was
under the orders of Commodore Griffith, of the Nonsuch, senior officer of his
Majesty's ships and vessels at Rhode Island; and it will appear by the following
secret order, that he was kept at the most important point in advance.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>(Secret.)<br />
"By Walter Griffith, Esq. Commander of a division of his Majesty's ships and
vessels at Rhode Island.</p>
<p>"The employment of the galley under your command being necessary in the
Seakonnet Channel, with the intention to intercept any armed vessels fitted by
the rebels for putting to sea from the harbours or creeks communicating
therewith; but more particularly to defeat any attempts they may propose for
making a descent in force, or attacking the post occupied by the king's troops
on the eastern shore of Rhode Island; you are therefore to proceed to the
aforesaid channel, and put yourself under the command of the superior officer
there, for those purposes accordingly: but you are, nevertheless, at liberty to
move <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>the galley (under the orders of the commanding officer there) from time to
time, to prevent the enemy from being able to ascertain the position thereof,
either for executing any meditated insult on the galley, or to pass you
unobserved during the night; taking care, however, to keep as much as may be
within such limits, as will fully enable you to effect the principal object of
your appointment as aforesaid.</p>
<p>"It will become requisite for this end, to have your boats (or other
better-appointed craft, with which you can in future be supplied), advanced at
seasonable lines, both for the earlier discovery of any ships or vessels
attempting to pass your station in the night, and preventing any other
advantages attempted by the enemy under cover thereof.</p>
<p>"The crews of the boats so directed should be prudently cautious in boarding
vessels of inconsiderable appearance, that they may not be exposed to suffer by
the treacherous practice of the enemy in different modes to blow up and destroy
your men; but a suitable discretion will be no less requisite on your part,
that, in warning them of these hazards, they are not induced to become remiss in
their exertions in the essential services.</p>
<p>"If the enemy should attempt to pass your station with any ship of apparent
force, great attention will be requisite that you may not be misled by such not
improbable expeditions to draw you from your station, and thereby facilitate the
means to succeed with less risk in a meditated descent on the eastern shore of
the island; which is to be at all times the object of your chief care to resist
and oppose, by endeavouring to destroy the boats of the enemy employed on that
occasion, or otherwise to prevent the further use of them in the attempt.</p>
<p>"It will therefore be incumbent on you, in conjunction with other armed vessels
stationed with you in Seakonnet <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Channel, to intercept the said armed vessels
(if possible) before they have advanced below your first anchoring station, and
to keep secret such directions as the senior officer at the said anchorage may
propose to adopt for that intent.</p>
<p>"You are to continue on this service until further orders; and I am to recommend
your attention, that a careful watch is kept in the galley at all times,
conformable to the tenour of the printed instructions given in that respect; and
that every other precaution is taken to guard against the attempts of the rebel
for the annoyance of the galley, wherein it is to be observed of all such
enterprises, that those which are the least suspected are ever the most likely
to be attended with success.</p>
<p class="right">"Given on board H.M.S. Nonsuch,<br />
at Rhode Island, 21st May 1778.<br />
<span class="smcap">S.W. Griffith.</span></p>
<p>"To Lieut. Saumarez, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>It should be mentioned here, that Rhode Island was taken possession of
by his Majesty's forces under General Clinton and Sir Peter Parker on
the 9th December 1776; and some description of it is necessary to show
the arduous as well as perilous nature of the service on which our
young hero was now employed. This island takes its name from the
province, and lies in Narraganset Bay: it is fifteen miles in length
from north to south, and three miles and a half broad; the north end
is only three miles from Bristol, to which there is a ferry. The
Seakonnet Passage separates it from the main on the north-west side,
and the islands of Conanicut and Prudence lie in the passage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> on the
south-east side, the town of Newport being in the south-east part of
the island.</p>

<p>The Seakonnet Passage was in consequence of the above order allotted
to the Spitfire. Lieutenant Saumarez was now under the orders of
Captain Gr&aelig;me, and proceeded to his station: it appears from his
journal, now in our possession, that he was constantly on the alert,
and almost daily skirmishing with the enemy. On the 24th he had to
sustain the attack of three armed boats which came off from Point
Judith, and had nearly decoyed them on board; but they found their
mistake in time to escape after a good drubbing. On the same evening
he joined a detachment of five hundred men, which, under cover of the
Flora, had landed above Bristol and burnt one hundred and twenty-five
batteaux-plats, an armed galley, and a privateer of fourteen guns,
besides destroying the greatest part of the town. On the 30th April a
firing was heard in the direction of the Taunton: the Spitfire
immediately weighed, and ran over to the enemy's shore, where
Lieutenant Saumarez opposed his vessel to a field-piece, which
returned his fire without doing any injury for a considerable time;
this was meant as a diversion to enable the 54th regiment to attack
unobserved, which in the mean time landed up the Taunton, destroyed
eight sawmills and several flat-boats, and came off by the assistance
of the Spitfire with inconsiderable loss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 1st of May the Spitfire weighed, and was beating against the
wind to obtain her station, when, by the vessel missing stays, she got
aground on Sandy Hook. On this, the enemy immediately brought down a
gun, but without effect. An anchor was carried out; the vessel was
hove off without damage, and reached Fogland Battery, off which she
anchored, and the next day reached her former station.</p>

<p>It will be needless to notice every occasion wherein the Spitfire was
engaged with the enemy, which, while Lieutenant Saumarez commanded
her, was no less than forty-seven times! but we shall proceed to the
period when his operations in that vessel were drawing to a close. The
Americans, who had publicly declared their independence on the 4th
July 1776, had concluded a treaty with the French on the 13th March
1778, which was considered by the British government as a declaration
of war; and the French ambassador being directed to withdraw, the
following orders were issued to the squadron at Rhode Island by
Commodore John Brisbane, who had now taken the command:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>"By Captain John Brisbane, Captain of H.M.S. Flora, and
senior officer of his Majesty's ships and vessels at Newport, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>"In pursuance of an order from the Lord Viscount Howe, vice-admiral of the
white, and commander-in-chief of his Majesty's ships and vessels employed on a
particular service, you are hereby required and directed to <span class="smcap">MAKE</span> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span class="smcap">WAR UPON</span>,
take, or destroy any part of the French squadron lately arrived on the coasts of
this continent, as well as other ships of war of that nation appearing on the
coasts of North America, to the utmost of your ability, until further orders,
keeping this secret. Dated on board H.M.S. Flora, at Newport, Rhode Island,
26th July 1778.</p>
<p class="right">(Signed)<span class="smcap"> J. Brisbane.</span></p>
<p>"To Lieutenant Saumarez, commanding<br />
<span class="left5">the Spitfire, galley."</span></p></div>

<p>This order was transmitted with an enclosure, designated "Copy of a
paragraph of a letter received from Lord Viscount Howe, dated off
Sandy Hook, 19th July 1778."</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>"As there is not a sufficient naval force for the defence of Rhode Island, and
none can be sent while the French squadron, at anchor off Sandy Hook, continues
so much superior to that under my command, it may not be unseasonable to remind
you that you are at liberty to apply the force under your direction, by landing
of guns and men for the service of the batteries; dismantling, and even
destroying the ships, to strengthen the defences of the post in the most
effectual manner, in case of an attack upon the post, more especially when no
longer in prospect of rendering better assistance under the same circumstances,
or preventing the capture of the ships.</p>

<p>"Every captain or commander is therefore directed to attend to the foregoing
paragraph, and act from circumstances, in the best and most effectual manner
possible for the defence of the post, and ship or vessel under his command, so
as to answer the intention of his lordship. Dated on board H.M.S. Flora,
Newport Harbour, 27th July 1778.</p>
<p>"To Lieutenant Saumarez, commanding<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>The French, who had secretly been assisting the Americans, and had
long been preparing for war, sent a powerful fleet from France, which
arrived, and anchored off Sandy Hook, while Lord Howe was within the
harbour with a very inferior force, but could not be attacked: they
therefore bent their course to reduce Rhode Island. On the 29th of
July they were discovered; and, on the 4th of August, two ships of the
line and two frigates entered the passage, where the Kingfisher sloop,
the Alarm and Spitfire, galleys, were stationed; and it being no
longer possible to prevent them from falling into the hands of the
enemy, their stores, guns, and crews were landed, and the vessels set
on fire.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>
<p>After the destruction of his little vessel, the Spitfire, Lieutenant
Saumarez was attached to the division of sailors under Commodore
Brisbane, to whom he became aide-de-camp. This division consisted of
the crews of the frigates and other vessels which had been destroyed,
on the following day in the southern passage, to prevent their falling
into the hands of the enemy. The vessels destroyed, in addition to
those mentioned in the last chapter, were, the Juno, Lark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> Orpheus,
and Flora of thirty-two guns, and the Cerberus of twenty-eight.</p>

<p>The artillery and stores had been in part landed, and mounted in
various positions on the island; while the seamen and officers,
amounting to above a thousand men, were actively employed there during
the whole of the siege. Lieutenant Saumarez was stationed latterly in
command of one of the advanced posts, and had several opportunities of
distinguishing himself in repulsing the repeated assaults of the
enemy, and in attacking them in return.</p>

<p>The plans of the French for the reduction of Rhode Island having
failed, and their fleet having been dispersed in a storm, during which
some were disabled, and others captured, and finally the appearance of
Lord Howe with a reinforced but still inferior squadron, induced them
to abandon the project, and, after refitting at Boston, to steer for
the West Indies.</p>

<p>The officers and seamen, being now no longer wanted, were ordered a
passage home in the Leviathan of fifty guns, on board which ship
Lieutenant Saumarez embarked, in company with Captains Dalrymple,
Smith, Hudson, Brisbane, Symons, and Gr&aelig;me, whose ships had also been
destroyed. As she was approaching the English Channel, the Leviathan
was overtaken by a violent storm, and most providentially saved from
shipwreck by the clearing up of a thick fog just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> in time to avoid the
danger, when they found the ship close to the Rocks of Scilly, near to
the spot where Sir Cloudesley Shovel was lost. This circumstance has
been attributed to a strong northerly current, but it was probably
from the position of these dangerous islands being inaccurately laid
down in the charts; it is indeed an extraordinary fact, that an error
of no less than three leagues in their situation was first discovered
by the Swedish surveyor, Nordenanker, about the commencement of last
war. The Leviathan, nevertheless, arrived safely at Portsmouth about
the beginning of the year 1779, when Lieutenant Saumarez had again an
opportunity of visiting his family and friends in Guernsey.</p>

<p>He had, however, resided there but a short time, when he was appointed first
lieutenant of the Edgar of seventy-four guns, then fitting at Woolwich for the
broad pendant of Commodore Elliot. After receiving his letter of appointment, he
was obliged to wait some time for an opportunity to cross the channel; but at
length availed himself of the Ambuscade, which touched at Guernsey. Having
arrived at the Isle of Wight, Captain Phipps, her commander, ascertained that
the squadron under Admiral Drake, to which he belonged, had sailed from
Spithead; therefore without touching at Portsmouth to land Lieutenant Saumarez,
he proceeded to join the Channel fleet, which he found twenty leagues to the
westward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> of Scilly, having on the way retaken the Helena sloop of war; to
command which Sir John Warren, then first lieutenant of the Victory, was
appointed, and Mr. Saumarez was ordered in his stead to join the Victory, then
bearing the flag of Sir Charles Hardy, at whose request he was continued in that
ship, where he was third lieutenant in seniority, but supernumerary on the
books. Besides the commander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, Rear-Admiral
Kempenfelt, as first, and Captain Collings, as second captain, were both on
board the Victory detached to cruise off Brest, commencing in June 1779, and
returning occasionally to port until May 31st, 1780. After the death of Sir
Charles Hardy, which took place on the 9th May 1780, Admiral Geary, and then Sir
Francis Drake, succeeded to the command, with Captain Clayton as captain.</p>

<p>The Victory continued on the same service until the spring of 1781, when Admiral
Hyde Parker hoisted his flag, and Mr. Saumarez now became first lieutenant. He
had been so zealously attentive to his duty, that for several months he never
went on shore, till at length he yielded to the persuasion of his messmates. On
arriving at Point Beach, Portsmouth, he was accosted by a person in French, who
demanded the way to the admiral's house, and at the same time informed him that
he had just landed with the intelligence that Jersey had been attacked by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> the
French. Mr. Saumarez immediately went with the messenger to the admiral, who
despatched him as a courier to town, and he returned in a remarkably short time
with orders respecting it. In short, his diligence and zeal were so manifest in
every service on which he was employed, that he soon gained the esteem and
friendship of Vice-admiral Hyde Parker, who, in June 1781, was appointed to the
command in the North Seas, and shifted his flag into the Fortitude, Captain
Robertson. The squadron in those seas, when under command of Commodore Keith
Stewart, was of inconsiderable strength, but had now risen to a force of five
ships of the line, besides one fifty, one forty-four, and three frigates.
Notwithstanding the desire of Lord Sandwich, then first lord of the admiralty,
to provide for his own friends, the admiral succeeded in carrying with him, from
the Victory, Lieutenants Waghorne and Saumarez. On the 3rd of June they sailed
from Spithead to Sheerness, and, after refitting and touching at Leith, sailed
to bring home the Baltic convoy from Elsineur, about the beginning of July.</p>

<p>The squadron, which might have been made much stronger, consisted of the
Fortitude, seventy-four, Captain Robertson; the Princess Amelia, eighty, Captain
Macartney; the Berwick, seventy-four, Captain Fergusson; the Bienfaisant,
sixty-four, Captain Braithwaite; the Buffalo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> sixty, Captain Truscott; the
Preston, fifty, Captain Gr&aelig;me; the Dolphin, forty-four, Captain Blair; the
Latona, thirty-eight, Sir Hyde Parker (the admiral's son); the Belle Poule,
thirty-six, Captain Patton; the Cleopatra, thirty-two, Captain Murray; and the
Surprise, cutter, Lieutenant Rivett.</p>

<p>The Dutch by this time had declared war, and, being perfectly aware of the force
of Admiral Parker's squadron, sailed with a large convoy for the Baltic, under
command of Admiral Zoutman, whose squadron was one ship of the line superior; it
became, therefore, necessary to take the Dolphin, of forty-four guns, into the
line, although she had only eighteen-pounders on the lower deck.</p>

<p>But before entering into the details of the action which took place on the 5th
of August 1781, it is proper to give some of the particulars of each squadron.
That of Admiral Parker was totally unfit for the line of battle; the ships had
been but a short time together, and had only two or three times practised the
usual man&oelig;uvres of forming the line, &amp;amp;c. The Fortitude was a small
seventy-four, but well manned. The Princess Amelia was an old eighty-gun ship,
with reduced metal and masts. The Berwick was a good ship, and, in addition to
her metal, had two sixty-eight-pounder carronades on the poop; but next to her
was the Dolphin, forty-four, with only twenty twelve-pounders on the lower-deck,
which could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> not be expected to make any impression on a sixty-four. The Buffalo
was formerly the Captain, of seventy guns; but, in the commencement of
hostilities, not being thought efficient as a ship of war, she was fitted up as
a mast-ship and her name changed; but, probably for want of vessels, she was
again equipped for war with sixty guns, but only with eighteen-pounders on the
lower deck. The Preston was a good fifty-gun ship, with her proper metal,
twenty-four-pounders on the lower, and twelve-pounders on the upper deck. The
Bienfaisant had the metal on her lower deck reduced. The Artois, which
afterwards joined the squadron, was the finest frigate then known; had
twenty-eight, eighteen-pounders on her main deck, with, in addition to her
complement of guns, heavy carronades on the quarter-deck and forecastle; she was
manned with three hundred men. The Latona was a fine thirty-eight gun frigate,
with eighteen-pounders; the Belle Poule and Tartar were excellent of their
class.</p>

<p>The Dutch squadron consisted of one seventy-four, one sixty-eight, one
sixty-four, and five fifty-fours. In the action there were five frigates, the
other five having gone off with the convoy; the list of both will be found in
the Appendix to this volume, with that of the killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The Dutch squadron and convoy, which were bound to the Baltic, were discovered
at four o'clock in the morning about six leagues to leeward;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> and there being a
fine commanding breeze and smooth water, everything was favourable, as well for
detaching the convoy, which was immediately done by signal to the Tartar, as for
making dispositions to attack the enemy. The admiral seeing that they had their
own port (the Texel) directly to leeward, and being doubtful that they would run
in there for shelter, or at least go nearer to the shore, made the signal to
chase at thirty-five minutes past four, which obliged every ship to make sail
instead of preparing for action with a superior enemy. At five, Admiral Zoutman
hoisted Dutch colours, and his men-of-war drew out from the convoy, which took
their station under the lee to await the event. At half-past five, the admiral
made the Tartar's signal to stay by, and part company with the convoy, which
then hauled their wind, made sail to the south-west, and was soon out of sight
and danger.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past six, the signal for the line of battle abreast was made,
which allowed the headmost ships to take in small sails; and immediately after
another signal was given for the Dolphin and Preston to change stations; this
was a serious mistake, as it led our squadron to believe that the admiral meant
to engage the ship ahead of the Dutch admiral, and not that of the latter, which
was actually his intention. This unfortunately placed the Dolphin in opposition
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> one of the largest of the enemy's vessels; and while it left the rear-ship
(the Bienfaisant) for some time without an opponent, the van-ship Berwick and
the Dolphin had to engage three of the enemy.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Dutch were regularly drawn up in a line of battle ahead,
on the larboard tack, the ships being about a cable's length apart, and keeping
a point from the wind, with their sails well proportioned to each other. They
appeared in excellent order, their hammocks stowed, and marines drawn up on the
poop.</p>

<p>At fifty-six minutes past seven, the signal for close action was made, and, to
the astonishment of our squadron, the enemy never fired a shot, although they
might have done considerable damage to our ships had they opened their fire on
them as they approached end on to them, on their weather beam. Not a gun was
fired on either side until within half-musket shot, when the red flag was
hoisted on both ships. Up to that moment all was silent, and it is scarcely
possible to conceive a silence more solemn and impressive! At the same instant,
they saw the signal go to the mast-head of Zoutman's ship. The dreadful silence
was now broken by the tremendous roar of cannon when within pistol-shot, and the
battle raged with the utmost fury for three hours and forty minutes.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, the signal for close action which had been made, was
repeated. The Berwick, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> forced the van-ship of the enemy to
edge off, fell to leeward of the line, and was consequently obliged to
make sail, tack, and regain her station in support of the Dolphin,
which had then two ships on her, and was also thrown to leeward. The
admiral, having now slackened the Dutch admiral's fire, passed ahead
of the Buffalo, on which the ships astern closed up to the Buffalo;
and the Berwick took the station ahead of the admiral. At thirty-five
minutes past eleven, the ships became unmanageable; and, the Dutch
dropping to leeward, the action ceased.</p>

<p>By some it has been affirmed that Admiral Parker should have renewed
the action: Lieutenant Saumarez says, it was certainly his intention
to do so; but the state of his own ship, and the reports he received
from others, rendered it quite impossible.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Dutch convoy had about the middle of the conflict bore up for the
Texel. The protection of them was no longer an object, and Admiral
Zoutman, as soon as he could possibly get his ships collected and put
before the wind, made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> best of his way into the port; but during
the night the Hollandia, Dutch seventy-four, was seen sunk in
twenty-two fathoms water, and her pendant was hauled down by Captain
Patton, of the Belle Poule, and brought to the admiral. As no ship was
taken, both claimed the victory: but, the convoy being sent back into
port and one ship sunk, should certainly decide it to Admiral Parker;
and had the English admiral not inadvertently rendered his van too
weak by the mistake in the signal which also extended his line beyond
their rear, thereby rendering one ship for a time useless, he would
have obtained a decisive victory.</p>

<p>While Admiral Zoutman must be admired for his cool intrepidity, it
must be admitted that he was much to blame in forbearing to avail
himself of the opportunity of attacking and disabling the approaching
fleet, which he might have done with great effect. After the Fortitude
had been put into a condition to make sail, Lieutenant Saumarez was
sent to conduct the Preston, one of the disabled ships, into port; her
commander, Captain Gr&aelig;me, having lost his arm in the action. When
Admiral Parker arrived at the Nore, his Majesty paid the squadron a
visit; but the veteran commander, indignant at the conduct of
ministers, who, he conceived, ought to have reinforced his squadron
instead of allowing some fine ships to lie idle in port, received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> the
King with that rough <span class="italic">hauteur</span> peculiar to himself, observing, "I wish
your Majesty better ships and younger officers. As for myself, I am
now too old for the service."</p>

<p>On this occasion Lieut. Saumarez was presented to George III. The King
inquired if he was related to the captains of the same name one of
whom had circumnavigated the globe with Anson, and who had fallen
gloriously in the service of their country: the admiral replied in the
affirmative, saying, "Yes, please your Majesty; he is their nephew,
and as brave and as good an officer as either of them."</p>

<p>In consequence of the bravery and skill he displayed in this action,
Lieut. Saumarez was promoted to the rank of commander, although only
second lieutenant; the first being wounded early in the action, the
duty had fallen on our hero: and he was immediately appointed to the
Tisiphone, a fire-ship constructed on a new plan, and armed with
carronades, which was then fitting at Sheerness; his commission as
"master and commander," bearing date for that ship, the 23rd August
1781.</p>

<p>When lieutenant of the Fortitude, with Admiral Sir Hyde Parker,&mdash;who,
from his acerbity of temper, was distinguished from others of the same
name by the sobriquet of "Vinegar Parker,"&mdash;the old admiral betrayed
his ill-humour by unwarrantably finding fault with him one morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
when Mr. Saumarez commanded the watch; but soon after, probably to
make amends for such hasty and unguarded conduct towards an officer
for whom he had the greatest regard, he sent to invite him to dinner,
an honour which the young lieutenant declined in terms sufficiently
strong to indicate that his feelings had been hurt. On this, the
admiral sent for him and exclaimed, "What! can't you put up with the
fractious disposition of an old man?" The admiral, who could not bear
to be, even for a day, at variance with Lieutenant Saumarez, would do
anything to serve him; and, when he obtained the command on the East
India station, offered to take him with him in the Cato, which sailed,
and was supposed to have foundered off the Cape of Good Hope, as she
was never afterwards heard of; and he happily escaped sharing the fate
of that gallant chief and unfortunate crew.</p>

<p>The Tisiphone having been fitted out at Sheerness, and the complement
of men having been filled up by supernumeraries from the Conquestadore
at the Nore, Captain Saumarez, by order from Admiral Roddam, placed
himself under the command of Captain Allen, of the Sceptre, on the 6th
September 1781, from whom he received the following order:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>
You are hereby required and directed to put yourself under my command, and to
follow all such orders and directions as you shall from time to time receive
from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>me for his Majesty's service, and to hold yourself in constant readiness
to sail at a moment's warning; and in case of separation by any unavoidable
accident, you are to make the best of your way without loss of time to Torbay,
and put yourself under the command of Admiral Darby.</p>

<p>(Mem.) In case of your parting company with his Majesty's ship Sceptre, and
falling in with any ships or vessels belonging to France or French subjects,
Spain or Spanish subjects, the States General of the United Provinces, or to his
Majesty's rebellious subjects in the colonies of North America, that you can
cope with, you are to use your best endeavours to take, seize, sink, burn, or
destroy the same: giving me an account of your arrival at Torbay, and of
anything you may have so taken or destroyed.</p>
<p class="right">Signed.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wm. Allen.</span></p></div>

<p>In pursuance of these orders Captain Saumarez sailed from the Nore,
and, arriving at Torbay on the 17th, found that Admiral Darby had
sailed in the Britannia on the 15th, after having left orders for the
Tisiphone to cruise a week off the Lizard. Here he was directed to
proceed for Plymouth, where he arrived on the 1st of October; and
having received further orders to repair to Spithead without loss of
time, he arrived there on the 13th October, to fit for Channel
service. He now joined the fleet under Lord Howe, and, after a cruise
off Brest, returned to Portsmouth on the 21st of November: his ship
was found to sail extremely well.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez was now ordered to place himself under the command of
Admiral Kempenfelt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> who, with a detachment of twelve sail of the
line, was destined to intercept Count de Guichen, who had put to sea
from Brest, after having returned from his last severe campaign. The
count had been ordered to use every exertion to refit and prepare the
French fleet for sea, notwithstanding the lateness of the season. The
objects in view could be accomplished only by extreme diligence and
the most profound secrecy, as it was absolutely necessary to reinforce
Count de Grasse, with both ships and troops in the West Indies, as
also M. Des Ornes and Admiral Suffrein in the East. It was evident
that De Grasse, after his hard service on the coast of North America
during the preceding campaign, must stand in need of a vast supply of
naval and military stores; and the service he was about to undertake
in the West Indies would increase the want of provisions, and almost
every necessary of life and of warfare: neither was the demand for
naval and military stores in the East Indies less urgent. Accordingly,
a numerous convoy of transports, store-ships, and victuallers were
prepared and equipped at the same time as the fleet, which was now
extended to such a number of men-of-war as was considered sufficient
for the protection of the convoys until fairly out of reach. This part
of the service, as well as the charge of the whole expedition, was, as
we have stated, confided to Count Guichen; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> command of the
squadron and fleet destined to the West Indies, to M. de Vaudreuil.
The Tisiphone was the look-out ship of the squadron, which sailed from
Spithead at the end of November.</p>

<p>At day-break on the 12th December, Captain Saumarez, being the first
to discover the enemy, made known his situation to the admiral; which
was, that the men-of-war were too far ahead and too much to leeward of
the convoy to afford any protection to it. The admiral, with that
decision and professional skill by which he was so eminently
distinguished, determined to profit by their situation, and boldly
pushed between the convoy and the greater part of the enemy's
line-of-battle ships, and succeeded in capturing twenty sail. In this
affair Captain Saumarez had a noble opportunity of distinguishing
himself, by attacking the ship of war, of thirty-six guns, which was
bringing up the rear of the convoy, and capturing her after an action
of twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Besides those captured, many others had struck; but, the weather at
this time becoming thick and squally, the admiral discontinued the
chase of those which had been cut off, and which made sail in every
direction, that he might collect his squadron before dark, many of his
ships being at a great distance astern with the prizes. At daylight
next morning, the enemy's ships of war, twenty-one sail of the line,
were seen formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> to leeward; but their force was so much superior,
that the admiral did not think it advisable to risk an action. The
captured ships consisted of twenty-one sail of transports, having on
board eleven thousand troops, besides their crews of seven thousand
seamen; the greatest part of which were taken by this squadron, and
the Agamemnon, which picked up five or six more.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the force under Count Guichen, destined to
assist Count de Grasse in the capture of the valuable island of
Jamaica; was much greater than had been supposed by the English
government; and, consequently, it became of the utmost importance to
give the earliest information of the approach of such a formidable
enemy to Sir Samuel Hood. Accordingly, Captain Saumarez, whose gallant
conduct and zeal had been so manifest, was selected for this service.
His men were returned to the Tisiphone from the captured ships; and he
was detached with orders to push past the French fleet, and make the
best of his way to Barbadoes, (see Appendix) where he arrived on the
28th of January; and finding the Pegasus, Captain John Stanhope, he
delivered his despatches, and received the following orders from that
officer:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
You are hereby required and directed to proceed (without a moment's loss of
time) to the island of Antigua, where, on your arrival off English Harbour, you
are to send a boat in for intelligence respecting Sir Samuel <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>Hood and the fleet
under his command; which having received from the senior officer in that port,
you will proceed in search of the commander-in-chief, and deliver him the
despatches you are charged with from Rear-admiral Kempenfelt, as also those you
will receive herewith.</p>
<p>Given on board his Majesty's ship Pegasus,<br />
Carlisle Bay, this 28th Jan. 1782.</p>
<p>(Mem.) I recommend that particular attention may be paid to keep well to
windward of the French islands.</p>
<p class="right">Signed<span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Stanhope.</span></p>
<p>To Captain Saumarez, H.M. fire-ship <br />
<span class="left5">Tisiphone.</span></p></div>

<p>In pursuance of these orders, Captain Saumarez sailed from Barbadoes
on the 28th of January. In the mean time, the Comte de Grasse, who had
been beating to windward for some days with the intention of attacking
Barbadoes, but without gaining ground, had abandoned his plan, and
bore away for St. Kitts. On his arrival there, he landed eight
thousand men, and took possession of greater part of the island:
General Frazer, with a small party of six hundred men, was obliged to
retire to Brimstone Hill Fort.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Hood, notwithstanding the superiority of the enemy,
(twenty-nine sail of the line,) resolved on a sudden and unusually
bold man&oelig;uvre, namely, to sail and attack the enemy's fleet at
anchor. It was for this purpose that he had put to sea with twenty-two
sail of the line, and proceeded to Antigua, where he took in
provisions, and embarked the twenty-eighth and two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> companies of the
thirteenth regiment, under command of General Prescott.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez, according to the orders he had received, proceeded
for Antigua, and keeping "well to windward," as he had been directed
to do, fell in with the Triumphante and Terrible, two French
line-of-battle ships, of the squadron which had been attacked by
Admiral Kempenfelt on the 12th December, and which had been detached
by Comte de Guichen to Martinique. These ships immediately gave chase;
but, night coming on, Captain Saumarez had recourse to stratagem in
order to effect his escape, which would otherwise have been impossible
in consequence of the Tisiphone having carried away her fore-top-mast
in a squall, an accident which was fortunately not observed by his
pursuers: he now made night-signals by hoisting lights and burning
false fires; which having led the enemy to suppose he was
communicating with an English squadron, they abandoned the pursuit
after a chase of half-an-hour.</p>

<p>At the moment the fore-top-mast was carried away, Mr. Robb, one of the
midshipmen, who was looking out at the fore-top-gallant-mast-head,
fell on the forecastle without receiving any injury. This young
gentleman was an <span class="italic">el&egrave;ve</span> of Captain Saumarez, continued with him to
the end of that war, and embarked with him on board the Crescent in
1793. After the capture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> of <span class="italic">La R&eacute;union</span>, he was promoted to the rank
of lieutenant.</p>

<p>The fore-top-mast of the Tisiphone was soon replaced; and next day, on
reaching English Harbour, he learned that Sir Samuel Hood, with his
squadron was at anchor in Basseterre Roads, St. Kitts, where he had
three times repulsed the enemy of a much superior force, but which had
now taken up such a position as rendered it impossible for him to
communicate with the admiral; for, unless he would venture to push
through the intricate channel between Nevis and St. Kitts, he would
run the greatest risk of being captured. Undismayed, however, at the
danger of navigating an unknown passage, he fearlessly proceeded where
no ship had ever before ventured; and by sounding as he advanced, and
by the dexterous management of his ship, he succeeded in carrying the
Tisiphone to the anchorage at St. Kitts in safety; and delivered his
despatches to Sir Samuel Hood, who informed him that the intelligence
was of such importance, that it was necessary it should be immediately
sent on to Sir Peter Parker at Jamaica. But when the admiral proposed
to send the Tisiphone on with it, Captain Saumarez, desirous of
remaining at the seat of warlike operations, represented to him that
the Tisiphone was a fine fast-sailing ship on a new construction, that
in the existing state of affairs she might be useful, and that he
should be happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> to contribute by his own personal exertions to the
promotion of the public service; whereas any vessel could run down
with the trade-wind to Jamaica. Sir Samuel, no less pleased with the
proposal, and the manner in which it was made, than convinced of the
advantage he would derive from having with him a fast-sailing vessel
commanded by so zealous an officer, whose tact and intrepidity had
already been manifested, determined to keep the Tisiphone with his
squadron, and send a less useful vessel with the intelligence to
Jamaica. The admiral soon reaped the advantage of this decision.
Captain Saumarez, during the time the fleet remained there and at
Antigua, was the most active in harassing the enemy. He commanded
several boat expeditions, and cut out a vessel in a most gallant style
from Basseterre Roads and several other small vessels from the back of
the island.</p>

<p>The time, however, had now arrived when it was absolutely necessary to
send another despatch to England; and the admiral had no other small
vessel remaining but the Tisiphone. On the 7th February 1782, the
signal was made for an opportunity of sending letters to England, and
subsequently for the captain of the Tisiphone: Captain Saumarez had
been dining with his friend, Captain Charrington, on board the Ajax,
and it was some time before he reached the Barfleur; when he found to
his dismay and mortification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> that he was ordered home! In a short
time the despatches were ready, and he had taken his leave. He
described this interesting circumstance, on which it may be said his
fortune was founded, in the following manner to us, and we cannot do
better than give it in his own words.</p>

<p>"I was," says he, "in my own boat, with the despatches in my hand; and
with a heavy heart had ordered the bow-man to shove off, when Captain
Stanhope, of the Russell, came alongside, and seeing me called:
'Hollo! Saumarez, where are you going?'&mdash;'To <span class="italic">England</span>', said I, 'I am
sorry to tell you!'&mdash;'Sorry,' replied Stanhope; 'I wish I was in your
place; I want to go home on account of my health; and, if I had known,
I would have exchanged with you.'&mdash;'Perhaps it is not too late,' said
I.&mdash;'Hold on then,' said he, 'till I speak to the admiral, since I
have your leave.'"</p>

<p>By this time the Russell's boat was alongside the admiral's ship; and
at the word "Hold on!" which was emphatically repeated by Saumarez,
the bow-man hooked the quarter of the Russell's barge, and he remained
but a few minutes in breathless suspense; after which Captain Stanhope
appeared at the gangway, and called, "Come up, Saumarez." He was on
deck in an instant, and found that, on Captain Jackson being asked to
submit the proposal to the admiral, he said, "Let Captain Saumarez do
it himself, he is the fittest person."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>When Sir Samuel Hood heard the application, he was silent, and after
reflecting for a few minutes he said, "Captain Saumarez, you know not
how much I wish to serve you; Captain Stanhope shall go home as he
desires, and you shall have command of the Russell." Accordingly,
before the close of that day, Captain Stanhope was on board the
Tisiphone on his way to England; while her late commander was in
possession of his post-rank, and captain of one of his Majesty's ships
of the line of seventy-four guns; and all this effected in less than
two hours!</p>

<p>We cannot forbear making honourable mention of a trait of attachment
manifested on this occasion by the first lieutenant, a Scotch baronet
of an ancient family, who had not been at sea for twenty-two years,
when he was appointed to the Tisiphone. The conflict of this officer's
feelings between joy for his captain's promotion and regret at losing
so excellent a friend was far beyond description; but, as the moment
of parting approached, he selected what he considered most valuable,
and so earnestly did he press Captain Saumarez to accept some
testimonial of his esteem, that, finding a refusal would deeply wound
his feelings, he accepted a silver ladle marked with his initials,
which has ever since been carefully preserved in memory of its former
owner.</p>

<p>The same night Captain Saumarez took command of the Russell, he had
cause to find that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> promotion and honours bring cares. A report was
made to him that the ship was in a state of mutiny, and that a shot
had been thrown at one of the officers. He soon found, indeed, that he
had a most disorderly ship's company; but the firm, prompt, and
judicious regulations which Captain Saumarez immediately established,
brought the crew so effectually into order, that two months after, at
the memorable battle of the 12th April 1782, no ship was in a higher
state of discipline than the Russell.</p>

<p>It has now become necessary to give a brief account of the situation
of the hostile fleets at the seat of war in the West Indies. While the
enemy's troops were prosecuting the siege of Brimstone Hill, the fleet
under the Comte de Grasse had been reinforced, and either continued at
sea, near to Basseterre, or anchored in the old road. On the 13th, a
practicable breach being made in the works, the general and governor
having given up all hopes of succour, and his brave garrison being
reduced to five hundred men, they embraced the proposals of a
capitulation made by the Marquis de Boullie, who on the same day
proclaimed the surrender of Brimstone Hill to the admiral by a flag of
truce, which had been previously agreed upon. The British fleet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
which had till this time continued at the anchorage in which it had so
bravely resisted the attacks of the Comte de Grasse, who on the 14th
anchored off Nevis with thirty-four sail of the line, was now in a
perilous situation, especially as the enemy were erecting mortar
batteries on the hill opposite to the shipping; and as it was no
longer necessary for him to continue there, Sir Samuel Hood issued
orders to slip or cut cables <span class="italic">without signal</span> at eleven o'clock at
night, the sternmost and leeward-most ships first, and so on in
succession, and proceed under easy sail until directed otherwise by
signal. That this order might be punctually executed, the captains
were ordered to set their watches by the admiral's timepiece. The
movement was performed with the utmost order and regularity. Not one
ship was molested or pursued by the French fleet, which was lying
within five miles, and must have been astonished at this excellent
man&oelig;uvre of the British admiral, wherein the Russell had a
distinguished share. Soon afterwards, Nevis and Montserrat fell into
the hands of the French.</p>

<p>On the 19th February, Sir Samuel Hood anchored in St. John's Road,
Antigua; and on the same day, Sir George Rodney arrived at Barbadoes
from England with several sail of the line. On the 25th, he joined Sir
Samuel Hood off Antigua; and, three days after, three more sail of the
line arrived from England. Thus fortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> united, the admiral
proceeded to St. Lucia, to refit and complete with water. On the 14th
of March he put to sea, with a view of intercepting a large French
convoy which was expected to arrive from Europe; but, notwithstanding
the vigilance of the frigates, the enemy, by keeping close to
Guadaloupe and Dominique, effected their escape into Fort Royal Bay,
on the 20th and 21st, unperceived by any of our ships. When this
unlucky event was made known to Sir George Rodney, he returned to St.
Lucia, to watch the motions of the enemy. In the mean time the
Russell, which had been damaged by striking on a rock, was repaired at
the Carenage.</p>

<p>The Comte de Grasse was equally active in the equipment of his fleet,
in order to proceed to leeward and form a junction with the Spaniards,
for the purpose of carrying into execution their grand object&mdash;the
reduction of Jamaica, with an overwhelming force of sixty sail of the
line and twenty thousand troops.</p>

<p>At daylight, on the 8th April, Captain Byron, of the Andromache,
communicated to the admiral by signal the anxiously-expected
intelligence that the enemy's fleet, with their large convoy, were
coming out of Fort Royal Bay, and standing to the north-west. Sir
George Rodney first made the signal for all boats, and persons who had
been necessarily employed in watering, &amp;amp;c. to repair on board, and
immediately after to weigh. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> noon the whole fleet were clear of
Gros Islet Bay: Sir George stretched first over to Fort Royal, and
then made the general signal to chase north-eastward.</p>

<p>The enemy's lights were distinctly visible during the night; and as
their ships-of-war, though better sailers than the English, were
delayed by the convoy of transports, there was little doubt of
overtaking them. Accordingly, at daylight on the morning of the 9th,
some of the advanced ships were close up with their convoy under
Dominique, while their men-of-war seemed much scattered: fourteen of
the latter were between Dominique and the Saints, with a breeze from
east-north-east; but the rest were becalmed under the land about St.
Rupert's Bay, and one ship was observed at some distance in the
north-west.</p>

<p>About half-past seven, the van division, commanded by Sir Samuel Hood,
got the breeze; while the centre and rear, in which was the Russell,
continued to be becalmed. This of course caused a separation, but did
not deter Sir Samuel Hood from advancing, although he had only eight
ships to fourteen of the enemy. In the mean time, the French ship seen
in the north-west, which had got the breeze, boldly stood on and
weathered the Alfred, the van-ship of Sir Samuel Hood's division,
which bore up to allow her to pass; and, no signal having been made to
engage, not a shot was fired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>At nine o'clock the action began, and was maintained with determined
bravery for upwards of an hour, the enemy's ships which had the breeze
having borne down upon and engaged this division; the Barfleur and
others had, at times, three to one opposed to them; and in this attack
there can be but one opinion, that the Comte de Grasse displayed great
professional ability. At length the leading ships of the centre got up
with the enemy's rear, and were followed by the Duke, Formidable, and
Namur; the Arrogant lost her main-top-mast, as well as the Royal Oak.
The rear squadron, commanded by Admiral Drake, now came up, and the
Comte de Grasse prudently hauled his wind; and as his ships sailed
better than the English, he succeeded in gradually drawing off, and by
half-past one his fleet were all out of the reach of shot.</p>

<p>Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, lost his life in this his sixth
encounter with the enemy; and it is said that he bled to death after
his leg was shot off, before he was carried to the cockpit.</p>

<p>In the action of this day the Russell had only a small share, as she
belonged to the rear division of the fleet, and, being becalmed, could
not get up until the enemy had hauled off. The Royal Oak, Montagu, and
Alfred were the ships which suffered most, but not so much as to
prevent their being repaired at sea; while two of the enemy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> ships
were so materially disabled as to oblige them to bear up for
Guadaloupe. The necessary repairs of these ships were not completed
before the 11th, during which time the enemy, by carrying a great
press of sail, had gained so far to windward as to weather the Saints,
and were nearly hull down; and, as it was supposed that the Comte de
Grasse meant to abandon to their fate two of his ships of the line
that had been so much damaged in the late action as not to be able to
keep company, all hope of being able to come up with them seemed now
to vanish.</p>

<p>In the mean time the line had been inverted, which brought
Rear-admiral Drake's division in the van, and that of Rear-admiral
Hood, which had been engaged, in the rear. The signal having been made
for a general chase, the two ships above mentioned would have been cut
off, had not De Grasse been induced to bear down to their relief. This
brought the enemy so far to leeward, that the hope of forcing them to
engage was revived.</p>

<p>As soon as the commander-in-chief saw that the enemy's fleet was
sufficiently to leeward, he recalled the chasing ships, formed a close
line of battle, and carried sail to windward all night; during which
the French line-of-battle ship Le Z&eacute;l&eacute;, whether from injuries received
in action, or in running foul of another ship, lost her bowsprit and
fore-mast, and at daylight on the morning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> the 12th was seen in tow
of a frigate, both carrying all the sail they could, and steering for
Basseterre. Sir Samuel Hood being in the rear, and consequently
nearest these ships, was directed to detach some of his division in
chase of them; and the Comte de Grasse, seeing that they must be
inevitably taken, bore up with his whole fleet for their protection.
It was now impossible to avoid an action.</p>

<p>The ships which had been recalled from chase resumed their stations,
and a close line ahead was formed on the starboard tack, the enemy
being on the larboard. Having hauled their wind after they had
perceived the chasing ships recalled, they thus endeavoured to avoid
an action; but the English fleet could now fetch near the body of the
French. At half-past seven, therefore, the engagement began by Admiral
Drake's division, led by the Marlborough and Arrogant, fetching the
fifth ship from the van, and bearing up in succession. The Honourable
Hugh Lindsay, who was a midshipman in the Arrogant, informed us that
in that part, and in the whole of the action, the enemy fired so high,
that the three <span class="italic">trucks</span> of the Princessa's mast-heads were shot away,
and the consequence was that very few men were killed or wounded. The
Duke lost her main-top-mast, as she approached the centre of the
enemy's fleet.</p>

<p>At half-past nine the action became general: Admiral Drake's division,
in which was the Russell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> had now passed the rear of the enemy on the
opposite tack; and Captain Thompson, of the America, seeing that he
could fetch to windward of the enemy's line, wore without waiting for
the anxiously-expected signal, as did also the Russell; and we have
reason to know that Captain Saumarez rejoiced at this circumstance.
Captain Thompson, being an experienced officer and second in command,
gave a sufficient authority to any other officer to follow his
motions, and they now stood to the southward. The America, however,
did not continue long on that tack, and the Russell was consequently
separated from her and the whole division; as the signals to tack, and
soon after to wear, were not made and put in execution for an hour
afterwards by Sir Francis Drake, who was then considerably to the
northward.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Russell continued, and got up with the rear ship
of the enemy's centre division about eleven o'clock, with which she
exchanged broadsides. At noon, the wind, which was very light, changed
to the south, throwing both fleets into confusion; but this gave Sir
George Rodney, and three of the centre division, an opportunity of
passing through an opening it occasioned in the enemy's line, and
doubling on its rear division: all their attempts to form again were
in vain; the enemy's van could never come into action. After this, the
remainder of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> the day was spent in desultory actions of single ships,
without regard to the motions of each other; the signals to chase and
for close action being visible only at intervals.</p>

<p>It is here unnecessary to give a particular account of the events
which took place on this memorable day, or to allude to those
circumstances which have been so fruitful in controversy; more
especially as Rodney's public letter, and other official records, will
be found in the Appendix to this volume. We shall, therefore, confine
our observations to the positions and conduct of the Russell,
commanded by Captain Saumarez.</p>

<p>The Russell was the only ship belonging to the van (Admiral Drake's)
division, which had wore and continued her course soon after she had
passed the rear of the enemy. By standing to the southward again,
Captain Saumarez brought his ship into action, but to <span class="italic">windward</span> of
the enemy; and, at the time the wind shifted to the southward, Sir
George Rodney, in passing through the enemy's fleet, was surprised to
find an English ship to <span class="italic">windward</span> of the French. Having ascertained
it was the Russell, he declared emphatically that the captain had
distinguished himself more than any officer in the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> By this
favourable position, which he had thus gallantly obtained, after
receiving the more distant fire of several of the enemy's ships, about
three o'clock he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>was able to come up with and closely engage a French
seventy-four, and after exchanging broadsides with three others,
pushed up to the Ville de Paris, and after raking her, having
maintained a position on the lee quarter, poured in a most destructive
fire, until the Barfleur, Sir Samuel Hood's flag-ship, came up.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Blane, in his account of this period of the battle, says:
"It was late in the day when the Ville de Paris struck her colours:
the ships immediately engaged with her at that moment were the
Barfleur, the flag-ship of Sir Samuel Hood, and the Russell, commanded
by Captain Saumarez. The Formidable (in which was Sir Gilbert) was
right astern, and, having come within shot, was yawing in order to
give the enemy a raking broadside, when Sir Charles Douglas and I
standing together on the quarter-deck, the position of our ship opened
a view of the enemy's stern between the foresail and the jib-boom,
through which we saw the French flag hauled down." This fact has not
been generally stated.</p>

<p>But the anecdote which we are now about to relate, must remove every
doubt on the subject. In the autumn of 1808, when the Baltic fleet,
under command of Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, returned from the
Gulf of Finland, in company with the Swedish fleet, to the harbour of
Carlscrona, the Swedish commander-in-chief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> Admiral Palmquist,
Rear-admiral Nauckhoff, Commodore Blessing, Captain Tornquist, and
others, came on board the flag-ship, Victory, to pay their respects to
the admiral: they were of course asked to take some refreshment in the
cabin: on which, as on all other occasions where an interpreter was
wanted, we were of the party. The conversation naturally turned to the
actions wherein they each had served in early life, when it appeared
that the whole of the four officers mentioned had been brought up in
the French service, and had actually been in the battle of the 12th of
April 1782. When we acquainted them that Sir James Saumarez commanded
a ship in that action, they eagerly inquired the name; and being
informed it was the Russell, Captain Tornquist, who was in the
Northumberland, rising from his chair and seizing Sir James's hand,
exclaimed, "Mon Dieu! Monsieur l'Amiral, nous avons brul&eacute; le poudre
ensemble; allons boire un coup."</p>

<p>It is impossible to do justice to the scene which followed. The old
Swedish officer's joy at this discovery knew no bounds; they
completely "fought the battle o'er again;" and we found it distinctly
proved that it was the Russell, commanded by Captain Saumarez, which
gallantly engaged several of the enemy's ships for two hours, and at
six, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> pushed on to the Ville de Paris. Baron Rosenstien, who was
on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> board that ship, and Baron Palmquist, who was on board La Couronne
stationed next to her, declared that the Compte de Grasse, who was
then attempting to escape to leeward, would have succeeded had it not
been for the Russell. During our sojourn among the Swedes in that and
another winter, we often heard the history of that memorable battle
repeated; and they never ceased to maintain the circumstance we have
stated, of which we made a memorandum at the time.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>We took leave on that occasion to say to Sir James, that we believed
the credit had been given to another ship; to which he replied, "Yes,
it was; but what Admiral Palmquist and Captain Tornquist has told you,
is true: it <span class="italic">was</span> the Russell that engaged the Ville de Paris until
the Barfleur came up." But such was the extreme sensibility of
Saumarez, that he could not persuade himself to correct the error,
from an idea that such an interference might argue a desire to sound
his own praise; and, but for the circumstance we have now related, the
truth might never have come to light.</p>

<p>In answer to a letter from Captain Thomas White, which he sent to Lord
de Saumarez with a copy of his publication, called "Naval
Researches,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> written in 1836, to defend the gallant Rodney from
certain attacks and allegations which had been published, <span class="italic">not</span> to
give a "full and perfect account of the battle, but," says Captain
White, "more particularly that part where your lordship so ably
commanded the Russell, which portion of our fleet the tongue of
calumny has never ventured to assail," Lord de Saumarez wrote the
following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Guernsey, 13th June 1836.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I beg</span> to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, accompanying your interesting
publication, which you have done me the favour to send for my acceptance, and
which has been forwarded to me by Lord Amelius Beauclerc.</p>
<p>I regret that you have (inadvertently, I am persuaded) fallen into the same
error as some of your predecessors, in detailing the account of Lord Rodney's
victory of the 12th of April, by ascribing to the Canada what is alone due to
the Russell, which ship I commanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>I shall for your information briefly state the circumstance to which I allude.
After passing the sternmost of the enemy's ships, the America, the ship astern
of the Russell, wore to stand after them: I was glad to have the example of an
old experienced officer, and wore also; but Captain Thompson, finding there was
no signal, shortly after wore again, to join Sir Samuel Drake's division. I
stood on, till passing a division of four of the enemy's ships, I exchanged
broadsides with them, and finally came up with the Ville de Paris, wore under
her stern and engaged her on the quarter for some time, when the Barfleur came
up, and the Comte de Grasse hauled down his colours.</p>

<p>Even at this distant period, I have a perfect recollection of the transactions
of that day. I shall only add, that I am convinced that no officer who was on
board the Canada in the victory of the 12th of April, will assert that she was
engaged with the Ville de Paris at the time stated. The present Admiral Giffard
was, I believe, one of the lieutenants, to whom I wish to refer you.</p>
<p class="left70">I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">De Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Captain White, as well as other officers, is of opinion that Admiral
Drake's division should have tacked sooner; and, as circumstances
happened, it would doubtless have been better if he had done so; but
probably the admiral, in continuing to stand on the same tack, had
calculated that the wind would continue in the same direction, or
alter to the northward; in either case he would have weathered the
whole of the enemy's fleet, besides giving time to his division to
repair damages. The wind veering to the southward immediately after
his division had wore, had unfortunately the effect of throwing them
to leeward; whereas the Russell, which wore as above stated, was by
the same change of wind far to windward of his division and nearer the
enemy.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Ville de Paris struck her colours, which "went down
with the setting sun," than the Russell made sail in chase of one of
the French ships which had deserted her chief, as also did Sir Samuel
Hood; but their noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> efforts were arrested by the night signal to
bring to, which put an end to the battle in that quarter: and although
Commodore Affleck in the Bedford, and three others, who did not see
the signal, continued the chase, they were unable to come up with the
enemy, who escaped to leeward in small divisions and single ships,
leaving the Ville de Paris, the Glorieux, the Hector, and C&aelig;sar, in
possession of the English.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th no enemy was in sight, and the ships which
had been in chase returned to the fleet. Admiral Rodney, with his
prizes and the fleet, remained three days under Guadaloupe to repair
damages, which afforded the flying enemy an opportunity to escape;
but, on the 19th, the Caton and Jason, of sixty-four guns each, with
the Astr&eacute;e and Ceres, frigates, were added to the list of prizes by
the exertions of Sir Samuel Hood, Captains Goodall, and Linzee. On the
23rd of April, Sir Samuel Hood rejoined the fleet off Tiberoon;
whereupon Sir George Rodney proceeded to Jamaica with those ships most
disabled, among which was the Russell and the prizes, leaving Sir
Samuel Hood with a strong squadron to watch the enemy, should they
venture out and attempt to prosecute their attack on Jamaica.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more flattering than the reception that Sir George
Rodney met with at Jamaica from the inhabitants, whose anxiety was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> so
suddenly supplanted by unbounded joy; and who not only found
themselves freed from the danger of invasion, but beheld the principal
commander of that overwhelming force which had caused them so much
alarm a prisoner within their harbour, and six of his principal ships
having the English colours triumphantly waving over the fleur-de-lis
of France.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that, down to this period, the Ville de Paris
was the only <span class="italic">first-rate</span> man-of-war that had ever been taken and
carried into port by any commander of any nation! The Ville de Paris,
in the capture of which Captain Saumarez had a distinguished share,
was the largest ship in the French navy: she had been a present from
the city of Paris to Louis XV. and no expense had been spared to
render the gift worthy of the city and of the monarch. Her length was
185 feet 7&frac12; inches, her breadth 53 feet 8&frac12;, depth 22 feet 2, and
2347 tons' measurement; and the expense of building her and sending
her to sea is said to have been 156,000<span class="italic">l.</span> On board her at the time
of capture were found thirty-six chests of money intended for the pay
and subsistence of the men who were to be employed in the expedition
against Jamaica; and she had on board, at the commencement of the
action on the 9th, 1,300 men: in the other captured ships, the whole
train of artillery, the battering cannon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> and carriages meant for the
expedition, were found.</p>

<p>The loss of men in the British fleet in both actions was very small,
amounting to only two hundred and thirty-seven killed, and seven
hundred and seventy-six wounded; while the loss of the French was
computed to be three thousand slain, and double that number wounded.
In the Ville de Paris alone three hundred were killed.</p>

<p>In the engagement on the 9th of April, the French fleet consisted of
thirty-four sail of the line, and the British of thirty-six; but in
that engagement, two of the enemy's ships having been disabled, their
numerical force was reduced in the battle of the 12th to thirty-two
sail of the line: on the other hand, the French ships were much larger
than the British; and it was calculated by Sir Charles Douglas, that
the broadside of the French fleet exceeded that of the British in
weight by 4396 pounds, and their numerical superiority in men was much
greater.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April, the Comte de Grasse was removed to the
flag-ship; and, some days after, when Captain Saumarez went on board
the Formidable after the action, and several times after their arrival
at Jamaica, the Comte de Grasse acknowledged that the Ville de Paris
suffered very severely from the well-directed fire of the Russell.</p>

<p>Among the instances of heroic submission and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> perseverance under the
severest suffering, may be recorded the conduct of the captain of the
main-top of the Russell, who having received a shot that carried off
one of his arms, instead of requesting the assistance of his
companions to take him below, insisted that they should continue at
their stations, and let himself down by one of the backstays. After
suffering amputation, he persisted in going again on deck, where he
remained encouraging the men till the action terminated.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the fleet at Jamaica, the Russell was found to be in
so disabled a state, that Sir George Rodney intended to send her home
with the Ville de Paris and the other prizes, and arrangements were
made for that purpose accordingly. His old friend, Sir Peter Parker,
who had held the command at Jamaica, sailed in the Sandwich, on board
which ship was the Comte de Grasse, for England, with a convoy of
merchant-ships. After having been at sea three days, the Ajax, one of
the ships under his command, sprang a leak, returned to Bluefields
Bay, and the Russell was ordered to follow the fleet in her stead. The
exertions which Captain Saumarez used to refit his ship obtained the
commander-in-chief's highest approbation. In two days he was ready,
and immediately joined the Sandwich and Intrepid, which now sailed
with the trade under convoy, and preceded the prizes, which were not
yet ready to undertake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> the voyage to England; and it was owing to
this interposition of Providence, that the Russell escaped the
melancholy fate which afterwards befel the unfortunate fleet, in which
the ill-fated Ville de Paris was lost with all her crew. The Russell
had on board three hundred French prisoners and twenty-two officers,
and arrived at the Downs on the 29th July 1782. She was ordered to be
paid off at Chatham, to which port she proceeded. On her arrival
there, an order came from the Admiralty to draft her crew into a ship
which was under order to sail for the East Indies. This excited a
general murmur, and at length the men refused to obey. On Captain
Saumarez being informed of it, he went on board and remonstrated, when
they unanimously declared that, although they had but just returned
from a long voyage, they would follow him all the world over. Before
he left the ship, however, he prevailed on them to resume their duty;
and these orders were subsequently altered. After returning her
stores, the Russell was paid off on the 24th of September. Captain
Saumarez' acting commission as a post-captain, dated on the 8th of
February 1782, was confirmed by Earl Howe; and no officer in his
Majesty's service more richly deserved his promotion.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez having paid off the Russell, and distributed his crew
into different ships according to the final orders he had received
from the Admiralty, repaired to London, and after paying his respects
to Earl Howe, proceeded to Guernsey to receive the congratulations of
his numerous friends; but these were far from altering "the natural
bent of his disposition to do good." Instead of becoming elevated by
prosperity, his sincere and unaffected piety induced him to take a
leading part in the establishment of charitable institutions, and in
his own person to give "a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> striking and useful example of moral and
religious life." But his noble mind was never diverted from the
service and the good of his country; he was constantly attentive to
every circumstance that concerned the duties of his profession, and an
event occurred about this time that peculiarly interested him.</p>

<p>Although this was a period of profound peace, the ambition of France
was constantly awake. It had long been the object of the French
government to form a naval port in the British Channel, for the
evident, if not avowed, purpose of annoying our trade in time of war,
and disputing with us the dominion of the British seas. No labour
however arduous, and no expense however great, could check this
favourite design. The port of Cherbourg, which had long been fixed
upon as being immediately adjacent to our great arsenal at Portsmouth,
became the point of attraction. The unfortunate Louis XVI. had
determined to stimulate this grand undertaking by his presence, when
the first <span class="italic">cone</span> was submerged.</p>

<p>The assemblage of the French court opposite our own coast naturally
attracted a number of our countrymen, among whom was Captain Saumarez,
who was induced to cross the Channel probably by a secret wish to
examine the nautical projects of our rivals, to counteract which,
might at some future period become his duty. This was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> eventually the
case in 1793, when he captured the French frigate R&eacute;union off that
very harbour, from which she had sailed only a few hours before the
action.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez was present at the above imposing ceremony, and had
the honour of being introduced to the French king, by whom he was
treated with the greatest attention. It is worthy of remark, that this
was the only time during his long life that he ever set his foot in
France, and he returned directly to Guernsey much gratified by his
excursion.</p>

<p>Between the period of Captain Saumarez' departure from Guernsey in
1776, and his return in 1782, the island of Guernsey had undergone
great and important changes. The war with America had brought an
influx of strangers; wealth and its attendant luxuries had superseded
the simple mode of living of its inhabitants; society had extended;
and when the peace took place, at the close of 1782, no spot of its
size could display a greater appearance of prosperity, civilization,
and beauty.</p>

<p>Between the years 1785 and 1787, the island was twice honoured with a
visit from Prince William Henry, our <ins title="Corrected erratum: original reads 'present'">late</ins> most gracious sovereign;
and, however great the change had been in men and manners since it had
beheld a prince of the blood on its shores, the loyalty of the
islanders had sustained no diminution, and the arrival<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> of the prince,
then a lieutenant of the Hebe, Captain Thornborough, excited the most
unbounded joy. Every one's heart glowed at seeing the son of a monarch
whom they were accustomed to regard with veneration and love; and as
people who lived in the habitual belief that to "fear God and honour
the King" is a "united precept," every mark of respect and attachment
was exhibited on both occasions. When his Royal Highness came the
second time, as captain of the Pegasus, the homage, which had been
paid to him at the first visit, as son of their sovereign, was mingled
with respect to himself. Some there are who yet remember, and still
delight to relate, the account of the elegant <span class="italic">dejeun&eacute;</span> with which the
illustrious prince entertained a party on board the Pegasus; after
which his Royal Highness honoured Captain Saumarez and his brothers
with his company at dinner, and attended a ball in the evening at the
assembly-rooms.</p>

<p>In 1787, when Captain Saumarez had nearly attained his thirtieth year,
peace seemed to be completely established. At an early age he had
attained, by his own merit, the highest rank to which an officer could
be advanced: he had fully established a character equally exalted for
courage and professional talent; and having been, wherever Fortune had
placed him, always in the best society, his manners as a gentleman
were no less elegant than his person, which was tall and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> graceful,
while his handsome features denoted a heart susceptible of the
dictates both of humanity and love. It is not then to be wondered at,
when he returned to his native island, that he still cherished an
attachment which he had long formed; especially when he found her on
whom he had fixed his affections, possessed of every quality which
could ensure mutual happiness; neither can it appear surprising that
on her part the regard should be equally warm and sincere.</p>

<p>The appearance of hostilities in the same year, however, occasioned a
suspension of his matrimonial arrangements, as he was then appointed
by Lord Howe to the command of the Ambuscade frigate, which he had
scarcely fitted before she was ordered to be paid off, the hostile
differences having been adjusted. He now returned to Guernsey, and, on
the 8th October 1788, was united to Miss Martha Le Marchant, only
daughter and heir of Thomas Le Marchant, Esq. by his marriage with
Miss Mary Dobr&eacute;e, to the entire satisfaction of the families and
relations on both sides.</p>

<p>The following extract of a private letter to his brother Richard,
written a few days after his marriage, will give the reader a just
idea of the feelings which occupied his mind on this happy occasion:</p>

<p>"It is needless," he says, "to attempt giving you any idea of my joy
on this occasion. The abundant blessings which Providence is pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to pour down on me, who am ever unworthy the least of its favours,
makes my heart glow with boundless gratitude and love, which I hope
ever to testify by a life strictly devoted to His service. To have the
power of making her happy who has ever been the joy and delight of my
soul, far surpasses all that I had ever formed of felicity in this
world. I must also acknowledge the affectionate kindness of her
relations, who have for ever attached me to them by the confidence
they have placed in me."</p>

<p>These self-congratulations were, indeed, fully confirmed in after
life; for few husbands have ever been blessed with such a devoted
wife, or children with such an affectionate mother. During their
younger days, and when their gallant father was at sea, Mrs. Saumarez
lived retired, giving up her whole time to their instruction; and we
can most fully testify that gratitude for her maternal anxiety, both
for their spiritual and temporal welfare, has been indelibly impressed
on all their hearts.</p>

<p>After passing some time at Guernsey, Captain Saumarez removed to the
neighbourhood of Exeter, where he resided two years. In 1790,
appearances of hostility took place. The Spanish armament was not to
be lightly regarded. Captain Saumarez was appointed to command the
Raisonable of 64 guns; but he never went to sea in this ship, the
differences between the two nations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> having been amicably settled. It
seemed to show, however, that, in the event of war, he was one of
those who were to be actively employed.</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez remained on shore until the war occasioned by the
French revolution broke out in 1793, when he was appointed to command
the Crescent of 36 guns. His commission was dated on the 24th January,
and he hoisted his pendant in her at Portsmouth on the 28th of the
same month, receiving, at the same time, orders to place himself under
the command of Commodore Sir Hyde Parker. No sooner was it known at
Guernsey, and in Devonshire, that the Crescent was commissioned by
Captain Saumarez, than a number equal to half the complement of seamen
volunteered for the Crescent; and, on the 1st of February, the
Tisiphone sloop was sent to bring the men from Guernsey, while the
rest, from Exeter, were sent by the way of Plymouth to join the ship.
It could not but be highly gratifying to his feelings when he found
that so many of his countrymen had chosen to devote themselves to his
service; and he was soon able to report his ship ready for sea.</p>

<p>On the 10th of February 1793, in common with other officers, he
received the following intelligence that war had been declared against
France.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
By Sir Hyde Parker, Knt. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Accounts having been received that war was declared at Paris, by the National
Convention of France, against <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Great Britain and Holland; you are, in pursuance
of the King's pleasure, signified to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty by
the Right Honourable Henry Dundas, one of his Majesty's principal secretaries of
state, hereby required and directed to seize or destroy all ships and vessels
belonging to France that you may happen to fall in with.</p>

<p class="right">Given under my hand, on board the Victory,<br />
this 10th day of February 1793.<br />
<span class="smcap">H. Parker.</span></p></div>
<p>To Captain Saumarez, R.N.</p>
<p>The Crescent having been reported ready for sea on the 1st of March,
Captain Saumarez received orders to proceed to Guernsey with his ship,
accompanied by the Liberty brig, and three transports under convoy, to
reinforce the garrisons of the Channel islands. He had also sealed
orders, which were to be put in execution when the troops were landed
at Guernsey and Jersey. The following account of this cruise was sent
to his brother, on the ship's return to Guernsey Road.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">H.M.S. Crescent, Guernsey, 18th March 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard</p>

<p>As the detail of our proceedings on our first cruise cannot but be acceptable to
you, I take up my pen to communicate them. We anchored in this road on Sunday
morning, the day after we had sailed from Spithead. The independent companies
and invalids for this island were immediately disembarked. The wind being too
much to the southward for the transports to proceed to Jersey, they remained
till Thursday following, when I sent them under convoy of the Liberty brig.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, intelligence was brought to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>me that a French brig was seen
to the northward of the island, standing for the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Caskets'">Casketts</ins>. I immediately got
under way, and directed the Drake to do the same. We pushed through the Race of
Alderney during the night, and at day-break found ourselves close to the brig,
off Cherbourg. She is about 100 tons, from Vannes, loaded with salt, for Havre.
Seeing another brig and a galliot to the N.W. from us, I ordered the Drake and
Cockatrice to chase, and I have hopes they are also prizes.</p>

<p>About three o'clock, it blowing very hard, I was much surprised at an express
joining me from Alderney, with a letter from the governor, addressed to the
commander of H.M. ships off Alderney, mentioning that he had positive
information that the enemy meant to attack the island this or the following
night; and as there was no ship of force at Cherbourg but an old 64, with
frigate's masts, he was certain that the appearance of a man-of-war off
Cherbourg would preserve Alderney, and baffle the expedition. Chance having
thrown me off Cherbourg, within sight the whole day, I was happy the purport of
this letter was so fully answered. Expecting further intelligence, I waited till
a cutter hailed us that he was going express to Plymouth. No other vessel
appearing, I made sail for this island, and anchored in the road this morning. I
have scarcely a doubt that what caused your brother<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to be alarmed was the appearance of this ship, the
Drake and Cockatrice, with another small vessel in the Race of Alderney; and I
am sorry it was not in my power to acquaint him with it, as the vessel he sent
me returned immediately.</p></div>

<p>Captain Saumarez, on his return to Guernsey, wrote to Governor Le
Mesurier, and, in reply to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> his letter, informed him that the
appearance of the Crescent and squadron off Cherbourg had the desired
effect of baffling the meditated attack on Alderney; nevertheless, the
Crescent was detained on that station until the 25th, in consequence
of other reports of the enemy's intentions to attack either Jersey or
Alderney, and his squadron therefore was reinforced. In the mean time
he succeeded in filling up the complement of his crew at Guernsey, and
at length returned to Spithead, when some alteration took place in the
armament of his ship: having there completed his stores and
provisions, Captain Saumarez' next employment was to take a convoy of
transports with troops to Cork, and bring from thence two regiments to
Guernsey. This service occupied his ship until the 4th of May, when
she arrived off the Lizard, and, having sent part of his convoy into
Falmouth, he anchored at Guernsey on the following day.</p>

<p>He left Guernsey on the 15th of May, having six transports with French
prisoners on board, and arrived at Spithead on the 17th.</p>

<p>On the 22nd Captain Saumarez received orders from the Admiralty to
take the Hind, Captain Cochrane, under his command, and proceed with
the Crescent and that ship to cruise between lat. 51&deg; and 47&deg; N. and
long. 10&deg; to 16&deg; W. for the protection of the trade, and continue on
that service for three weeks. The account of this cruise, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
two prizes were taken, is given in the following letter to his
brother.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, Spithead, 26th June 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Dear Richard,</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to acquaint you with our return from a cruise which has been
rather unsuccessful, having only taken (besides the brig I informed you of) a
cutter called "Le Club de Cherbourg," of ten guns. She sailed from Brest on the
20th instant, and was found on the coast of Ireland, where she had done much
mischief on her former cruise, having taken four vessels within a few days. I
find by the prisoners that the French have only eighteen sail from Brest in
readiness for sea. They rendezvous in Quiberon Bay as soon as they are equipped.
I hope Lord Howe will soon give a good account of all of them. I anchored at
Guernsey for a few hours, where I left the cutter for my brother's disposal.</p>

<p> As we have been parted from the Hind since the 8th instant, I hope to find she
may have met with success. We are under agreement to share till the expiration
of our cruise. As I write before we anchor, you cannot expect I should give you
an account of my further destination; but, from what they informed me in the
island, we are to go with Lord Howe, which hurried me from there. All the family
were in perfect health at six o'clock on Tuesday evening, when I left them. We
must now console ourselves with the hope that we shall soon terminate the
business. I think this year will nearly do it. We anxiously sought for an
opportunity similar to the Nymphe. We traversed the bay (Biscay) in every
direction, without the appearance of a French ship; and on Monday we were all
day in sight of Ushant, but could never meet with any but neutral vessels. Our
next cruise may probably <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>prove more fortunate. With my affectionate love to my
sister and the children, I am, my dear Richard,</p>
<p class="left70">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen by the date of this letter, that the Crescent had
arrived at Spithead on the 26th, which is the date of his official
letter to the Admiralty, giving an account of the capture of Le
Club, which, being the same as already given, need not be repeated.</p>

<p>The Crescent, being replenished with water and provisions, was
directed on the 4th July to take on board a quantity of specie for
Plymouth, to which he sailed on the 5th, and, having delivered it
there, took a convoy from thence to the Downs, where he arrived on the
18th July, and, according to further orders, returned with the trade
under convoy from thence to Spithead on the 20th.</p>

<p>The following order, which Captain Saumarez received from the Lords of
the Admiralty, will show the nature of the service on which he was now
employed.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of Great
Britain and Ireland, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="smcap">Captain Saumarez,</p>

<p>You are to take his Majesty's ships named on the margin (Concorde and Thames)
under your command, (their captains being directed to follow your orders,) and
putting to sea with them and the Crescent, the moment the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>wind and weather will
permit, proceed and cruise between the latitudes of 49&deg; and 50&deg; 30' north, and
from sixty to one hundred leagues to the westward of the Scilly Islands, for the
protection of the trade of his Majesty's subjects, and the annoyance of the
enemy, taking all possible care of the above-mentioned frigates; and diligently
looking out for, and using your best endeavours to fall in with, the
homeward-bound convoys from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands, which are daily
expected, and which are to be the principal objects of your attention.</p>

<p>In case of falling in with either of the said convoys, you are to see, or cause
to be seen, such of the merchant ships or vessels as may be bound to Ireland, or
into the Bristol Channel, as far as may be necessary for their security, and
those bound into the English Channel, as far as the Start; and, having so done,
return with the frigates under your command to the above-mentioned station, to
look out for the other convoy; and, having met with it, to see, or cause to be
seen, such of the merchant vessels as may be bound to Ireland, and into the
Bristol Channel, as before directed, and to see those bound up the English
Channel off their respective ports, as high as Spithead, where you are to remain
until further orders, sending to our secretary an account of your arrival and
proceedings.</p>

<p>You are to continue on the above-mentioned service until the 20th of next month,
unless you shall have fallen in with both the said convoys sooner; when you are
to make the best of your way to Spithead, and remain there as above directed.</p>
<p class="right">Given under our hands, this 18th day of July 1793.</p>
<p class="right smcap">Chatham, J. Smyth, Ch<sup>s</sup>. S. Pybus.</p>
<p>To James Saumarez, Esq. &amp;c.<br />
<span class="left25">By command of their lordships.</span><span class="left5 smcap">P. Stephens.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Captain Saumarez received at the same time information of the number
of ships expected from the different islands in both the convoys, took
the Concorde and Thames under his command, and sailed from Spithead on
the 26th of July 1793.</p>

<p>Next to the command of a fleet, that of a squadron of frigates was at
this period of the war considered the most important, and it could not
but be highly gratifying to Captain Saumarez to find himself selected
again for such a desirable command; but Fortune did not favour his
little detachment. The convoys, which they had been sent to look out
for and protect, had arrived safely at the respective ports before the
squadron reached their destination, and they continued to cruise in
vain within the prescribed limits of their station, till at length
they were assailed by a tremendous gale from the south-east on the
17th of August, in which the Concorde parted company, the Thames lost
her bowsprit and bore up for England, while the Crescent sprung her
main-yard, and by a sudden shift of wind to the northward carried away
her main-top-mast, and, her orders for returning into port having
expired, she arrived at Spithead after an unsuccessful cruise.</p>

<p>The Crescent had not been in dock since the year 1785, and required
much refitting: Captain Saumarez, therefore, on reporting his arrival
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> the Secretary of the Admiralty, sent also a statement of the
ship's defects; in consequence of which, an order was sent for her to
be docked at Portsmouth, and refitted for Channel service, while one
hundred of her crew were lent to the Vanguard. As this process
required a considerable time, Captain Saumarez sent for his family;
and, having taken apartments at Ryde, had a few weeks of enjoyment in
their society, and of relaxation from the arduous duties of his
profession. The Crescent was received into dock on the 25th August,
and was again fit for sea on the 10th October, when he received orders
to hold himself ready to proceed at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>The Crescent being now ready for sea, but with thirteen men short of
her complement, Captain Saumarez applied to have the number filled up,
as her masts and yards were of the same dimensions as those of a
frigate of thirty-eight guns; he also requested such increase as the
Lords of the Admiralty thought proper: but these applications were
unsuccessful, and on the 10th of October he received orders from Sir
Peter Parker, the port-admiral, to "hold himself in constant readiness
to put to sea at a moment's warning;" and it was not long before the
following order was received from the Admiralty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

soon as you shall have delivered the pacquets you will herewith receive,
addressed to the commanding officers of his Majesty's troops serving in these
islands, you are to repair with the said ship off St. Maloes, and use your best
endeavours to obtain such information of the enemy's forces there, as
circumstances will admit.</p>

<p>To Captain Saumarez, R.N.</p></div>

<p>For several days previously to the 19th, it had been reported that a
French frigate usually quitted the port of Cherbourg at night, and
returned next morning with what prizes she had picked up: this,
together with the information that an armament was preparing for the
invasion of Jersey, caused Captain Saumarez to make extraordinary
exertions to get to sea; and, although the wind was light, he
fortunately succeeded in getting round St. Helens before night. Early
on the morning, on the 20th, he was close to the light-house off Cape
Barfleur.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p class="p2 center">ACTION BETWEEN THE CRESCENT AND REUNION.</p>
<p class="p2">
This gallant action, which we are now about to describe, having been
misrepresented in every account yet published, we have, in order to
make the circumstances attending it more easily understood,
illustrated the positions by a diagram, showing the masterly
man&oelig;uvre performed by the Crescent, and the relative situation of
the ships at the commencement and the end of the conflict. The
engraving shows the state and situation of the two ships at the time
the R&eacute;union surrendered.</p>

<p>During the night, the wind had been so far to the westward as to
enable the Crescent to fetch Cape Barfleur, while the R&eacute;union, which
left Cherbourg in the evening, stood to the northward, in hopes of
meeting with merchant-ships coming up Channel. The two frigates,
therefore, must have crossed each other at no great distance; but the
wind having changed towards the south about daylight, and the French
frigate being unable to fetch back to Cherbourg, broke off with her
head to the eastward, while the Crescent, by coming up on the opposite
tack, was enabled to weather and get in shore of the enemy.</p>

<p>Shortly after day-break Captain Saumarez saw two sail standing on the
starboard tack towards the Crescent, and it appears that they had
approached her within two miles before they discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> themselves to
be under the lee of an English frigate: they then tacked and made all
sail, either for the purpose of trying to escape, or to approach
nearer to Cherbourg, that they might have the assistance of their
consort then in the harbour with her sails hoisted up. It was soon
evident that the Crescent, now "clean out of dock," had the advantage
in sailing; and, by half-past ten, Captain Saumarez, by edging down,
took his position on the enemy's larboard quarter within pistol-shot,
when the action began.</p>

<p>Captain John Tancock, who was then a midshipman stationed on the
main-deck, says that the men had directions to fire at the rudder of
their opponent, which was very soon disabled, while the
main-topsail-yard and fore-yard were both shot away. The enemy fired
so high that scarcely any shot struck the hull of the Crescent; but,
consequently, her fore-topsail-yard, and soon afterwards her
fore-top-mast, fell over the starboard gangway. Hitherto the ship had
been kept in her first position by backing and filling the
mizen-topsail, but now she came to, and eventually <span class="italic">came round</span>: but
Captain Saumarez, whose presence of mind never forsook him, brailed up
the mizen, and, by keeping all the square-sails aback, gave the ship a
<span class="italic">stern-board</span>; at the same time, by keeping the <span class="italic">helm up</span>, she wore
round on her heel, obtaining a position under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> the stern and on the
starboard quarter, while the enemy was lying with his yards square and
totally unmanageable. This man&oelig;uvre is shown in the diagram, to
which an explanation is added.</p>

<p>C. The Crescent. R. The R&eacute;union. 1. Commencement of the action. 2. The
Crescent's track in wearing on her heel. 3. The position when the R&eacute;union
struck.</p>

<p>In passing under the enemy's stern, it was observed that his colours
had been shot away, and, supposing he had struck, the firing ceased;
but, on coming round on the starboard quarter, the enemy again opened
his fire. The Crescent, having now got her larboard guns to bear,
returned his broadside with such effect, that at twenty minutes past
noon the officers of the R&eacute;union waved their hats and flags to
indicate that they had surrendered. The engraving represents the
situation of the two ships at this moment; and Captain Sir Thomas
Mansel, who was then a midshipman, declares it to be correct.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">Action with the Crescent and R&eacute;union taken at the time the latter surrendered.</p></div>
<p class="p4"></p>
<p>The combat now ceased, and the prize was taken possession of by
Lieutenant (now Admiral) Sir George Parker, who received the usual
order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> to carry her into port. The French captain being sent on board
the Crescent, they began to remove the prisoners and repair damages.
When the action began, a ship had been seen under the land to the
eastward, about four leagues distant; this was supposed to be an
enemy: but it turned out to be the Circe, Captain Yorke, who joined
four hours after the action, and took part of the prisoners. In the
mean time the cutter made off towards Cherbourg, out of which harbour
the wind and adverse tide prevented the other frigate, said to be La
Semillante, from getting to assist the R&eacute;union.</p>

<p>The following very concise official letter to the Secretary of the
Admiralty from Captain Saumarez, supplies the rest of the detail.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, off Cherbourg, 20th October 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of my Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that this morning, being off Cape Barfleur in his Majesty's
ship Crescent, under my command, I fell in with a French frigate, which, after a
close action of two hours and ten minutes, struck to his Majesty's colours: she
proved to be the R&eacute;union, mounting thirty-six guns, and manned with three
hundred and twenty men.</p>

<p>I am singularly happy in being able to inform their lordships that she has been
obtained without the loss of a single man, or even any wounded, although her own
loss has been very considerable indeed, having, as the prisoners informed me,
one hundred and twenty killed and wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>I must beg leave to render the most ample justice to the officers and ship's
company of the Crescent, for their cool and steady behaviour during the action;
and I take this opportunity to recommend to their lordships' notice the three
lieutenants, Messrs. Parker, Otter, and Rye: their conduct has afforded me the
utmost satisfaction.</p>
<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i2">With the greatest respect, sir,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your most obedient and very humble servant</span>,</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>To Philip Stephens, Esq. Admiralty.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;The R&eacute;union was accompanied by a cutter, which did not attempt to
come into action, but made for Cherbourg.</p></div>

<p>Captain Saumarez was now on his passage to Portsmouth, where he had
left his wife and infant children only two days before, in pursuit of
an implacable enemy known to be not many leagues distant! It was the
first battle he had fought since he became a husband and a father; and
his feelings, as he returned triumphantly to the bosom of his family,
can be easier imagined than described.</p>

<p>The anxiety and excitement inseparable from the day of battle had
subsided, the prisoners had been removed, the captive Frenchmen with
whom he had been sympathizing had retired, and he was at length left
alone to meditate on that remarkable dispensation of Divine favour
which had been so fully and especially manifested towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> him: he had
gloriously wrested from an enemy, fighting under the proud banner of
liberty, a ship equal to his own in weight of metal and superior by
seventy men in numbers, after a furious contest of above two hours,
without a man being hurt by his opponent, who lost one hundred and
twenty men killed and wounded: a fact unparalleled in the page of
history. With the generality of mankind, such circumstances were well
calculated to raise feelings of proud exultation; but these were never
cherished in the breast of Saumarez. Having done all in his power to
soothe the affliction of his vanquished enemy, his first impulse was
to offer up his thanksgivings and acknowledgments to the great <span class="smcap">Giver</span>
of all victory, and to implore that his mind might not be too highly
elevated by his glorious success. After despatching his unpresuming
letter to the Admiralty, which has been already given, he wrote to his
brother, in London, the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, 21st Oct. 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>You will rejoice with me at the success that has attended our short cruise. On
Saturday evening we sailed from Spithead; and the next morning, being about
three leagues from Cape Barfleur, we saw two sail standing towards us from under
Cherbourg, which I soon discovered to be a French frigate and a cutter. We were
on the larboard tack with the wind off shore; I was happy in being able to keep
between them and the land. When <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>about two miles from us, the frigate tacked
with all her sail set, and the cutter made sail to windward: we edged down to
her, and at a cable's distance, at half-past ten, began the action, which
continued with scarcely any intermission two hours and ten minutes.</p>

<p>Both ships were soon cut up in their sails and rigging, our fore-topsail yard
being shot away, and soon after the fore-top-mast; the ship came to, and wearing
on the other tack, gave us an opportunity to fire our guns, which were so well
served that the French ship soon became unmanageable, and enabled us to rake her
fore and aft; in which situation she struck her colours. I must observe that
they had been before shot away, and, imagining she had struck, I gave orders to
cease firing; she, however, soon relieved us of our suspense by giving us her
broadside: we were so well prepared, and kept up so good a fire, that in a short
time after they waved their colours and made signs from the gunwale with their
hats that they had struck.</p>

<p>I immediately sent Mr. Parker to take possession of the ship, and send the first
and second captains on board the Crescent. They informed me that the ship they
had surrendered was La R&eacute;union, mounting thirty-six guns and three hundred and
twenty-one men. When we came into action, another frigate was in sight to the
eastward, which we took to be her consort; we therefore lost no time to exchange
prisoners, and repair our damages, in the best manner we could: she, however,
proved to be the Circe, and joined us four hours after the action ceased.</p>

<p>The circumstance that has made me most happy from this engagement is, that we
have not had a single person hurt by the enemy, and but one man injured, who had
his leg fractured by the recoil of a gun. There being little wind the sea was
perfectly calm; and I had the satisfaction to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>observe that most of our shot
were perfectly well directed. The enemy's frigate is indeed most sadly a wreck,
thirty-four men killed and eighty-four wounded, many of them mortally; one
officer only has suffered, being badly wounded. She was commanded by Citizen
Denain, capitaine de vaisseau, to whose obstinacy they ascribe the sacrifice of
many lives.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for me to observe, my dear Richard, the great happiness I
derive from the consciousness that this event will afford you and all our
friends particular satisfaction. My dear Martha, too,&mdash;I scarcely know how
I shall disclose the circumstance to her; it embarrasses me as much as if it
were a mournful subject. One observation is incumbent on me to make, namely,
that Captain Yorke used every possible exertion to join us sooner, and that he
has most readily afforded us every assistance we required,</p>
<p class="left55">I now remain, your ever affectionate brother,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Captain Saumarez had now realized his ardent desire for an opportunity
of distinguishing himself, such as was afforded to his gallant
brother-officer of the Nymphe; and it is a singular coincidence that
each should have written to his brother on the day of action, under
similar circumstances of triumph and excitement. These interesting
documents seem to have decided the superiority of the British over the
French navy, at the commencement of the French revolution, and in
reference to that of Saumarez, we cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> but dwell with admiration on
the humility and acuteness of feeling with which it is replete!</p>

<p>The Circe, which had joined four hours after the action, was
despatched to Guernsey to execute the service on which Captain
Saumarez had been ordered; but the Crescent and her prize, in
proceeding to Spithead, were detained by light winds and calms. On the
22nd, she arrived off the Isle of Wight, when Lieutenant Otter was
sent to Portsmouth in the boat with the following official letter:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, off the Isle of Wight, 22d Oct. 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I beg</span> you will be pleased to inform my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
that, being unable to gain Spithead from the prevailing calms, I have thought it
expedient to despatch Lieutenant Otter with the intelligence I have the honour
to convey to their lordships.</p>

<p>Having been prevented by the action with La R&eacute;union from complying with their
lordships' orders, I directed the Hon. Captain Yorke, who joined me in his
Majesty's ship Circe, to proceed with the pacquets I was charged with for the
commanding officers of his Majesty's troops at Guernsey and Jersey, and from
thence to proceed to St. Maloes, and return to Spithead, agreeable to their
lordships' orders.</p>

<p>I beg to observe, that Captain Yorke gave me every possible assistance, and has
taken one hundred and sixty prisoners from the R&eacute;union, which I directed him to
land in the island of Guernsey.</p>

<p class="left65">I have the honour to be, sir,<br />
<span class="left5">Your most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>To Philip Stephens, Esq.</p></div>

<p>The Crescent arrived at Spithead on the following day, and with her
prize was ordered into harbour; the former to have her damages
repaired, and the latter to be surveyed and purchased for his
Majesty's service.</p>

<p>Before we submit the interesting official and private letters which
Captain Saumarez received on his arrival, and which may be considered
as the best proof of the sensation which this gallant action created,
it becomes our duty to state the comparative force of the two
frigates.</p>

<p>The Crescent lost her fore-top-mast; her sails and rigging were much
damaged, but very few shot struck her hull; and the only man hurt was
at the first broadside, when his leg was fractured by the recoil of a
gun.</p>

<p>La R&eacute;union, on the contrary, had many shot in her hull, and her stern
was very much shattered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> After she was in dock, we saw where a shot
had entered the starboard quarter, and made its way out of the
larboard bow. It was said to have killed and wounded twenty-one men!
The head of her rudder and wheel were shot away, and the fore-yard and
main-topsail-yard came down early in the action: she was, in short, a
complete wreck, as represented in the plate. The hopes that the ship
seen to the eastward under the land was a friend, induced the French
captain to delay surrendering after defence could no longer be
effectual.</p>

<p>The head-money was only paid for three hundred men; but there was no
doubt that three hundred and twenty-one were on board at the
commencement of the action, as many of the slain were thrown
overboard, and the French officers, for obvious reasons, wished to
make their force less than it was. According to Captains Tancock and
Mansell, forty men were killed, and eighty wounded. The cutter which
was in company, believed to be L'Esp&eacute;rance, mounting fourteen guns,
made off for Cherbourg with sweeps and sails as soon as the firing
commenced. La R&eacute;union's consort, believed to be the Semillante, made
an attempt to get out of Cherbourg, but was prevented by the tide,
when she sent a boat full of men, it was supposed, to reinforce the
former, but which returned when it was observed that her fate was
decided. The French shore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> only five miles distant, was crowded with
spectators.</p>

<p>There is no action between two single ships on record, where
consummate skill in naval tactics has been so brilliantly and
successfully displayed as in that which we have just described. The
patriotic reader must not imagine that, because the Crescent had
"none" either killed or wounded, the captain and officers of La
R&eacute;union did not do their utmost, and far less that they were deficient
in courage. The severe loss they sustained, and the obstinacy with
which their ship was defended, has fully proved their bravery. Had the
Crescent at once boarded the R&eacute;union, which was in her power, and
carried her sword in hand, as in the case of the Nymphe and Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre,
it would have been perhaps better calculated to excite feelings of
admiration in the general reader, who is not acquainted with naval
affairs; but this mode of attack is one which, we must acquaint them,
might readily be made by any officer moderately skilled in naval
tactics. It is where the commander of a ship, by his presence of mind
and skilful man&oelig;uvring, succeeds in the defeat and capture of an
enemy, that the superiority is manifest; and it is to him who has thus
proved that he possesses the <span class="italic">tact</span> to accomplish his object, and yet
spare the valuable lives of his men, that the meed of praise is most
justly due.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am infinitely obliged to you for your kindness and attention to George Parker.
I have not as yet heard from Lord Chatham, but suppose I shall in a day or two.
This morning I reckon you will kiss hands, and return home "Sir James." Such an
honour obtained on such an occasion is worthy the solicitation of a duke. If
anything material occurs, be so good to favour me with a line. Lady Parker

<p>To Captain Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Captain Saumarez, after a happy visit to his family at Ryde, repaired
to London, on leave of absence; and, on being presented to his
Majesty, received the well-merited honour of knighthood, and his first
lieutenant (now Admiral Sir) George Parker, was promoted to the rank
of master and commander. Sir James, having applied for an extension of
his leave, enjoyed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> society of his friends in London until the
14th of November, when he and Lady Saumarez returned to their family
at Ryde. The following letter to his brother, descriptive of other
marks of respect which had been paid to him, will be read with
interest:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Ryde, Isle of Wight, 16th Nov. 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Brother,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not before yesterday that we were enabled to return to our little
treasure in this island, owing to official business and the badness of the
weather. We found all in perfect good health except our little girl, who has
been for some time very unwell, and has suffered exceedingly; she is at present
rather better, and we hope her disorder is past its height. Mr. Le Marchant has
fixed for next Monday to leave the island. I shall endeavour to accompany them
to Southampton, and, after that, trust to opportunities hereafter offering to
enable me to see them at Bath.</p>

<p>I do not expect the Crescent will be ready to leave the harbour before the
middle of next week; what our destination will then be must remain uncertain.
Sir John Jarvis has this morning made the signal for sailing, and it is expected
will put to sea on Monday or Tuesday next. I mean to return to Portsmouth to-day
or to-morrow, that I may have an opportunity of seeing General Dundas before his
departure.</p>

<p>Our last letters from the island (Guernsey) are of the 6th; no particular news.
You will be concerned to hear of the fate of the unlucky Thames; when the
particulars are received, I am persuaded it will be found that the ship has not
been given away. The report is, that, after a severe action with a
six-and-thirty, she was next day attacked by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>the Carmagniolle, to which ship
she struck. Sir E. Pellew is cruising with the Circe off St. Maloes; the French
have no ships at present at Cherbourg.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received a very polite letter from Mr. Marsham, inclosing the
resolution of the 14th instant from the committee for encouraging the capture of
French privateers, voting me a piece of plate, value one hundred guineas, which
I consider a very high compliment paid to my earnest endeavours. But I am not
quite so well pleased with a letter from Mr. Cooke, who has the distribution of
the fees which he says are due from those who receive the honour of knighthood,
and which amount to 103<span class="italic">l.</span> 6<span class="italic">s.</span> 8<span class="italic">d.</span> In reply to this, I have referred him to
whoever paid the above fees for Sir E. Pellew, on whom that honour was conferred
on a similar occasion. I fear it may not be taken well; at the same time, I
think it hard to pay so much for an honour which my services have been thought
to deserve.</p>

<p>Captain Parker came down to Portsmouth last Thursday, without having obtained an
interview with Lord Chatham. I am, however, persuaded he will soon get a ship.
The other arrangements are not yet made. Mr. Warren has gone to London, to
endeavour to get over the difficulty of not having served his rated time; if he
does, he is to be third lieutenant.</p>

<p>You must now permit me to return you and my dear sister our most sincere thanks
for the kind hospitality we experienced under your roof; we not only ate of your
board and drank of your cup, but you gave us your very bed to repose on: when
shall we have it in our power to requite such goodness? At any rate, receive
this tribute of our warmest gratitude.</p>

<p>I hope your dear children, whom we almost considered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>as ours, are very well:
bestow on them a thousand kisses from us. With our most sincere love, I remain,
my dear brother,</p>
<p class="left65">Ever affectionately yours,</p>

<p>On the 22nd of November, the Crescent came out of harbour, and was
reported ready for sea; and Sir James Saumarez was now ready to
proceed, and to add fresh laurels to those he had so gloriously gained
in the service of his king and country.</p>
<p class="p4"></p>

Shipwreck.&mdash;Off Havre.&mdash;Cherbourg.&mdash;Private Letters relating the
particulars of several Cruises on the French coast.&mdash;Gallant Action with a
French squadron of superior force off Guernsey.</p></div>

<p>Sir James was now placed under the orders of Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride, who gave
him the command of a squadron, consisting of the Crescent and Druid,
frigates, Liberty brig, and Lion cutter. The first service he had to
perform was to carry a small convoy of transports with troops, &amp;c. to
Guernsey and Jersey, and furthermore to obtain pilots for the
admiral's squadron.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to describe the enthusiastic reception which Sir
James and his gallant crew received from their loyal and patriotic
countrymen in these islands; but his stay was short. Despatching the
Liberty to reconnoitre St. Maloes, he proceeded to Jersey, and, having
reconnoitred Granville, returned to Guernsey Roads on the 28th of
November, when he detached the Lion with pilots to the admiral; and,
pursuant to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> orders, sailed to the adjacent coast of France to assist
the royalists.</p>

<p>The following is his account of an attempt to attack a French squadron
in the bay of Brehat.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, off Guernsey, 7th Dec. 1793.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you, that pursuant to your orders I sailed from
Guernsey Roads the night of the 5th instant, in his Majesty's ship Crescent,
under my command, together with the Druid frigate and Liberty brig. The wind
being to the southward, we were unable to fetch to windward off Cape Frehel in
the morning; and observing several sail at anchor off the isles of Brehat,
particularly two large ships and a brig, in a bay to the northward, which there
appeared a great probability of attacking with success, I stood in for them; but
the tide of ebb setting us to the westward, prevented our fetching into the bay,
and enabled the enemy's ships to get under way with the first of the flood, and
save themselves between the rocks. We were however in time to fire several shot
at the largest, which, as well as the others, appeared armed <span class="italic">en flute</span> and deeply
laden.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to follow them without endangering his Majesty's ships, I
stood out of the bay through a passage which both the pilots I had on board
assured me was perfectly safe.</p>

<p>We soon found ourselves deceived, perceiving several rocks which we with
difficulty cleared. Unfortunately the Druid, (which I hailed to acquaint her of
the danger,) in wearing, tailed on a sunken rock; and, although she floated in a
few minutes, she has I fear received so much damage as to require her to be
taken into dock.</p>

<p>I have directed Captain Ellison, whose activity and exertions <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>cannot be too
highly praised, to proceed to Plymouth, and the Liberty to accompany him into
the Sound, and rejoin you without loss of time.</p>
<p class="left55">I am, with every respect, sir,<br />
<span class="left5">Your obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Rear-admiral John M<sup>c</sup>Bride.</p></div>

<p>On Sir James's arrival at Guernsey, he addressed the following letter
to his brother in London, which continues the narrative of his
proceedings on that dangerous coast.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>I take the first opportunity to send you an account of an enterprise which, had
it been attended with success, would have proved fortunate indeed. Not having
time to send you the particulars, I have enclosed a copy of my letter to the
admiral, which you will show to M. Le Mesurier. I have only to add, that the
object in view justified the attempt; but, as the world too often forms its
judgment from events, I fear we shall not acquire much credit for the attempt.</p>

<p>At midnight, we providentially escaped getting wrecked on the Rocks Douvre, in
steering after the Druid. We were warned of our perilous situation by the noise
of the breakers, and had only time to avoid them. In short, my dear friend, when
I consider our disappointment, and the very wonderful escapes we have had, it is
almost too much for me, and I can only be thankful things are not worse.</p>

<p>Accounts have lately arrived from the army of the royalists, that they are in
possession of Rennes, and we have reason to expect soon to hear of their having
a seaport wherein we can land the reinforcement. Four <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>French frigates have been
in sight of the island these two days; the more mortifying as we cannot detach
after them without leaving the troops embarked unprotected. An expedition of
this consequence should have at least the support of two ships of the line.</p>

<p>Be careful that nothing that I write to you transpires. I have lately seen
paragraphs which have given me concern, particularly one mentioning my being
ordered off St. Maloes. Be assured they may occasion much mischief and distrust,
if it can be imagined that they originate from any of my friends. My brother has
shown me the P.S. of your letter to him: I think it best the plate should be
confined to a dinner-set, as I am unwilling to separate the whole of a present
so handsomely bestowed; therefore, if not too late, I wish you to direct
accordingly. Lady S. writes to me that our dear little girl is better; I wish to
hear that she is sufficiently well to be inoculated. I shall be happy to have it
over.</p>

<p>You are a long time without writing to me. Although I know you are most hurried
at this time, you must forgive me if I desire you will devote a few spare
minutes to me; my sister, I am sure, will consent to it. Assure her of my
sincere love; and believe me truly,</p>

<p class="left60">My dear Richard,<br />
<span class="left10">Yours affectionately,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>

<p> P.S.&mdash;We are close ship-keepers, being all on board by six o'clock; a very
proper regulation. I do not expect to sail before the fleet proceeds to the
French coast, when I hope our accounts will prove more favourable.</p></div>

<p>We have here two other remarkable instances, where on sudden and
unexpected danger appearing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> the presence of mind and professional
skill of Saumarez saved his ship and squadron from destruction; and
although the bold attempt he made to attack the enemy was
unsuccessful, he does not less deserve the merit of making it, for we
cannot command the wind and tide.</p>

<p>The Crescent continued to cruise with Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride's squadron
during the winter, making several attempts to assist the royalists on
various places on the coast of France, and annoying the enemy's
coasting trade.</p>

<p>The following letters from Sir James to his brother in London, give a
particular account, in his own words, of the arduous services on which
he was employed during that time.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, Cowes Roads, 25th January 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>You will not expect so soon to hear from me, but I must just give you a journal
of our short cruise. The day after we sailed from here, we chased three armed
brigs off Havre, which were very near captured by the Flora and this ship. The
day following, Sir John Warren having detached me and La Nymphe to look into
Cherbourg, on the very spot where La R&eacute;union fell into our hands, we were on the
point of taking a French frigate, apparently of twenty-eight or thirty-two guns.
The wind at first flattered us with the hope of cutting her off from the land,
when it shifted and enabled her to get into Cherbourg: they were decidedly
frightened, and kept firing guns as signals to their ships in the bay, which
never attempted to come out to their assistance, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>although we were alone, as La
Nymphe was scarcely discernible from this ship. The next day La Nymphe sprung
her fore-mast, which obliged her to return to Spithead.</p>

<p>I appeared close to Cherbourg all day yesterday, in the hope of drawing their
ships out, which I plainly discerned to consist of six frigates, four of which
were large. In the evening it coming on to blow hard, and no appearance of our
ships, I stood off shore, and at noon this day, it blowing a severe storm, I
anchored in this road. Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride having consented to my going to Bath for
twenty-four hours, I am setting off with all speed: not having time to add more,
I remain, with my kindest love,</p>
<p class="left60">My dear Richard,<br />
<span class="left5">Yours ever affectionately,</span></p>
<p class="right">Sunday Morning.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I really intended to write to the Lord Mayor, but have not a moment's
time; I shall therefore leave you to acquaint him with our return here.</p></div>

<p>We may stop here to mention, that in the debate in the House of
Commons on the address to the King's speech at the opening of
parliament, the gallant conduct of Sir James Saumarez was mentioned in
terms of admiration, and his late action quoted as a remarkable
instance of the superiority of our naval commanders in professional
talent and skill; the account of this had been transmitted to him from
London by his brother Richard.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cowes, 2nd February 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>I left my dearest concerns yesterday morning, and arrived here this afternoon,
after a six hours' storm, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>from Southampton. Both your kind letters afford me
infinite satisfaction. When I wrote to you on Sunday, I had not the admiral's
consent to remain till I heard from him, and only expected to remain twenty-four
hours in Bath; but depended, nevertheless, on hearing from you there. You must
therefore desire my sister to plead in your behalf, when she writes to Lady S.</p>

<p>I am much flattered at my name having been found worthy of notice in the House
of Commons, and I thank you for the praise you bestow on me for the business of
our last cruise. Though we failed in taking the frigate, it was certainly a
matter of exultation and triumph to me, in a single ship, thus to brave the
enemy off their port.</p>

<p>I find Sir John Warren has sent in an armed brig, which we were prevented from
sharing, at the time we were in pursuit of the frigate: we decoyed her to within
a small distance from us by showing French colours, and I am persuaded we should
have taken her, if we had chased her instead of the frigate; and they ought in
justice to allow us to share in the profits of this prize.</p>

<p>I would advise you to wait till Donaldson's plates come out for your paintings.
Let me caution you against purchasing any of the prints, as I have engaged
fifteen sets for my friends, in order to have proof engravings.</p>

<p>Tom<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> writes to me they are under serious apprehensions for the island. I own
to you I think there is some cause, unless we keep a strong squadron for their
defence; at the same time, I do not believe they have so strong a force as
mentioned, or that they are making preparation for invading this country. Let me
know what <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>has become of Mr. Warren, and whether Captain Parker has sailed.</p>

<p>I must now wish you and my sister, and all under your roof, a good night. And</p>
<p class="left60">I remain truly,<br /></p>
<span class="left5">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<p class="right">Monday morning.<span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;Our admiral has not yet made his appearance, a vessel is gone to
Portsmouth for him. The packet returns so speedily that it is next to
impossible to answer letters the same day.</p>
<hr class="c15" />
<p class="p2 right">Crescent, Spithead, 24th February 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>You will be pleased to hear of our being safe in port in the midst of the
prevailing storms, but not without our having previously felt their rigour. Last
Thursday morning we carried away our main-top-mast; and, in going to Torbay soon
after, we sprung our fore-yard, which made the admiral determine to send us to
Spithead to refit, and afterwards join him with all possible despatch. We are
just anchored; but it blows so very hard, there is no possibility of sending a
boat on shore.</p>

<p>I left the squadron anchored in Torbay yesterday evening, where they are well
sheltered from the present very high wind. Let me hear from you, if possible, by
the next post. Not expecting to be ordered here, I wrote to Lady S. yesterday
morning, desiring her to direct to me there; and would have written to you to
the same purpose, but that I expected to have sent my letters from here by this
evening's post, which would have reached you equally soon.</p>

<p>I think this weather will, for the present at least, let us sleep in
tranquillity, and make our enemies set aside their projected invasion. Let them
attempt it when they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>will, I shall view it as a desirable event for this
country. But I am not of that opinion with regard to our islands.</p>

<p>God bless you, and preserve them all! Let us deserve well, and there is nothing
that we may not confidently expect from his providence. And, with my sincere
love,</p>
<p class="left65">I am ever affectionately yours,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>P.S. Sunday morning.&mdash;I availed myself of a favourable time this morning to
come on shore, and have just received a letter stating that the Liberty had been
chased by two frigates off the Casketts.</p></div>

<p>The following letter gives an account of his visit to the island of
Jersey, &amp;c.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Bouley Bay, Jersey, 30th March 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>I have at length had an opportunity of visiting this island, the admiral having
detached this ship and the Druid to look into Cancalle Bay and Granville. It
falling calm on Thursday evening, we anchored in St. Owen's Bay; and, next
morning, Captain Ellison and myself went on shore to wait on Lord Balcarras. We
called on Mr. Dumaresq on our way to St. Hilliers, who most obligingly assisted
us with horses, and accompanied us to town after having engaged us to dinner. I
had just time to call on our friends John Durell and Mr. Wm. Dumaresq, who were
very kind in their offers of service. We then returned to St. Peter's, and I
shall ever be thankful for one of the most pleasant days I have passed since I
commanded the Crescent. Lord Balcarras and his aides-de-camp were the only
strangers; Major and Mrs. Le Couteur were of the party; and they were all to
have favoured me with their company on board the following day, had not untoward
circumstances prevented that pleasure. In the evening <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>we had so thick a fog
that it was impossible to join the ships; and at day-break we had the
mortification to find, that, the wind having come to the southward, they had
found it necessary to leave the bay. They however soon made their appearance,
and with some difficulty I got on board.</p>

<p>The weather not permitting our going on the French coast, I anchored in this
bay, and detached a lugger with the third lieutenant, which will execute the
service better than we could in the ships. They are here greatly relieved from
their fears by knowing our squadron is so near them; and the ladies that at
first emigrated are now returning. Write to me by the packet to Guernsey.</p>

<p>When we can ascertain the force at Cancalle, I hope we shall find ourselves of
sufficient strength to pay them a visit. If the emissaries are to be credited,
they are disembarking their troops, and marching against the royalists in La
Vend&eacute;e.</p>

<p>I hope my sister continues well, as when I left you. And, with kindest love,</p>
<p class="left60">I remain, yours ever affectionately,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Sunday evening.&mdash;P.S. Mr. French, third lieutenant, is this moment
returned. He reports that eleven sail of frigates are in Cancalle Bay
only;&mdash;not the least appearance of ships of the line.</p></div>

<p>After remaining some time on this dangerous station, the Crescent and
squadron returned to Plymouth, when Sir James Saumarez was employed on
the expedition under Earl Moira, which need not be detailed here. On
the 11th May he received orders to take a squadron under his command,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to cruise off the Lizard. The following letter is relative to this
cruise:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, at sea, 14th May, 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Pursuant to your directions, I dispatch the Mary cutter to Plymouth for any
orders you may be pleased to send me, and I avail myself of this opportunity to
acquaint you with the proceedings of the squadron from the time of our
departure.</p>

<p>We made sail to the southward on Sunday night, and saw nothing except two
neutral vessels. One of them was informed by Sir Richard Strachan, that on the
6th instant he fell in with a squadron of French frigates in lat. 47&deg; 50' N.,
long. 6&deg; 15' W.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, about eighteen leagues to the southward of the Lizard, the
weather having proved hazy, on clearing up we saw a ship and a brig, which we
soon distinguished to be enemy's cruisers. I made the signal for general chase,
and endeavoured to cut them off from the French coast. We pursued them till
within four miles of Ushant, when they escaped through the passage De Four. I
then made the best of my way to regain the station; and we are now anxiously
looking for the frigates we sailed in pursuit of, with the hopes of better
success.</p>

<p>I beg to assure you of my most earnest endeavours to merit the confidence you
are pleased to repose in me; being, with great truth,</p>
<p class="left60">My dear Admiral,<br />
<span class="left5">Your most faithful</span><br />
<span class="left10">and obedient servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride, Plymouth.</p></div>

<p>It was in the interval between December 1793 and June 1794, that Sir
James Saumarez and Sir Edward Pellew, and Sir John Warren, being each
in command of squadrons of frigates, agreed to share prize-money until
the latter should return to port, which did not take place until June.
It is notorious in the navy that this led to a dispute, and
consequently a coolness, between these gallant officers, but the
misunderstanding was subsequently made up, and need not be farther
alluded to.</p>

<p>On the 1st June Captain Saumarez returned to Plymouth from the coast
of France adjacent to the Channel islands, and on the 6th received the
following order from Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>
You are hereby required and directed to take under your command his Majesty's

<p>Sir James sailed on the 7th from Plymouth: the following is a copy of
his official letter, giving an account of his action with the French
squadron:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, Guernsey, 8th June 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you that this morning, at dawn of day, being with
his Majesty's ship Crescent, under my command, and the Druid and Eurydice
frigates, about twelve leagues to the northward of Guernsey, on the larboard
tack, with a fresh breeze to the N.E., we fell in with five sail of ships and a
cutter to windward. From their not bearing down, and other circumstances, I did
not take them for enemy's ships; and I directed Lieut. Baker, of the Valiant,
armed lugger, to make sail to windward, for the purpose of reconnoitring them.
At six o'clock they hoisted national colours, and fired on the lugger. I then
shortened sail to form the line; but the Eurydice sailing so indifferently, and
having so superior a force to contend with,&mdash;three of the enemy's ships
being large frigates, with another which I took for the Thames, and one
apparently of twenty-four guns,&mdash;I directed Captain Cole to make all the
sail he could and stand in shore, Guernsey at the time being in sight.
<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p class="p4"></p>

<p class="center"><a href="images/131-b.jpg">View larger image</a></p></div>
<p class="center">Commencement of the action between the Crescent and her squadron, with the
French squadron of superior force off Guernsey.</p>
<p class="p4"></p>
<p>I remained with this ship and the Druid under easy sail to windward.
The two headmost ships of the enemy kept up a brisk fire as they came
up; which was returned, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>at too great a distance to do any
considerable damage. At eight, the Eurydice being so far in shore as
to run no risk of their coming up with her, and the whole French line
coming up within gun-shot, I made sail with the Druid for the
Hanoways.</p>

<p>Observing the headmost of the enemy gaining very fast on the two
ships, I hauled in for the shore with the view of drawing off her
attention; which answered my purpose, as she immediately hauled up
after me, and maintained a brisk fire for some time, but without
effect. She then bore away, but the Druid and Eurydice were too far
ahead; and soon after they hauled their wind to the northward.</p>

<p>I feel every satisfaction in acquainting you that, from the spirit and
bravery of my officers and men on this occasion, I am persuaded it
would have had every effect, had we had a more equal force to contend
with. I met with a noble support in Captain Ellison; and I have only
to regret that Captain Cole was not in a ship of sufficient force to
allow of my deriving advantage from his tact and intrepidity.</p>
<p class="left50">I am, with every respect, sir,<br />

<p>Thus it appears that the French were 100 guns, and 3556 pounds in
weight of metal, superior to the English squadron.</p>

<p>This exploit, which has been justly considered by every officer of the
navy a masterpiece of professional skill, as well as of presence of
mind and intrepidity, should be more particularly related than in the
above very modest public letter. The superiority of the enemy being
much too great to be opposed with any chance of success, it became the
imperative duty of Saumarez to effect, if possible, the escape of his
ships, to which the enemy immediately gave chase. Observing that his
own ship and the Druid had the advantage in sailing, and that the
Eurydice, which was not only in bad condition but a bad sailer, would
fall into their hands, he shortened sail, and having ordered the
Eurydice by signal to push for Guernsey, he contrived, by occasionally
showing a disposition to engage, to amuse the enemy, and lead him off
until the Eurydice was safe. He now tacked, and, in order to save the
Druid, closed with the enemy, passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> along their line; and the
capture of the Crescent seemed at one time inevitable. The Druid
meanwhile made her escape, with the Eurydice, into Guernsey Roads.</p>

<p>But Sir James Saumarez had for his own preservation a scheme which, in
the first instance, required great courage; in the second, a perfect
knowledge of a most dangerous and intricate channel; and, in the last,
a consummate skill in the management of his ship. He was himself well
acquainted with the coast, and possessed an experienced pilot, John
Breton, a native, whose house was on that extremity of the island. As
soon therefore as the other two ships were secure, he bore up as if to
run his ship on the rocks, to avoid capture. Ordering his pilot to
steer the Crescent through a narrow passage between the rocks, which
had never before been attempted by a ship of her size, and defying the
enemy to follow him, he reached the anchorage in safety,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to the no
small surprise and mortification of the French, who, after firing some
time over the rocks at the ship, were obliged, by the shot of the
Crescent and that of the batteries, to give up the contest.</p>
<p class="p4"></p>

<div class="blocquote">
<p class="center">Close of the action when the Crescent retreated among the rocks at Guernsey.</p></div>
<p class="p4"></p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that, after passing through the narrow channel,
the ship had to sail so near to the shore of C&acirc;tel parish, that he
could distinctly see his own house,&mdash;a position truly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> singular, for
behind he beheld a French prison, and before him his own fireside!
While passing through the narrowest part of the channel, Sir James
asked the pilot if he was sure he could see the marks for running
through? when he replied, "I am quite sure, for there is <span class="italic">your</span> house,
and there is my own!"</p>
<p class="p4"></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">Chart of  the island of Guernsey, showing the positions of the English and French

<p class="p4"></p>
<p>The gratification which Sir James must have felt in having, by his
admirable skill and daring, so completely succeeded in saving the
whole of the ships, could not but be highly augmented by the
circumstance of his countrymen, and even his family and friends, being
eye-witnesses of his gallant and judicious conduct.
Lieutenant-governor Small, who, with a multitude of the inhabitants,
beheld the whole of these masterly evolutions, immediately published
the following flattering testimonial in his general orders, which was
afterwards transmitted to Sir James by the brigade-major in a polite
letter.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Parole, <span class="italic">Saumarez;</span> countersign,<span class="italic"> Crescent.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>The lieutenant-governor cannot, without doing injustice to his own feelings,
help taking notice thus publicly of the gallant and distinguished conduct of Sir
James Saumarez, with the officers and men of his Majesty's ships Crescent,
Druid, and Eurydice, under his command, in the very unequal conflict of
yesterday, where their consummate professional skill and masterly
man&oelig;uvres demonstrated with brilliant effect the superiority of British
seamanship and bravery, by repelling and frustrating the views of at least
treble their force and weight of metal.</p>

<p>This cheering instance of spirit and perseverance in a detachment of our royal
navy, could not fail of presenting an animating and pleasing example to his
Majesty's land forces, both of the line and island troops, who were anxious
spectators, and beheld with admiration the active conduct of their brave
countrymen.</p>

<p>To the loyal inhabitants of Guernsey it afforded cause of real exultation to
witness the manly and excellent conduct of an officer of whom this flourishing
island has to boast he is a native.</p></div>

<p>The governor of Guernsey, as a further mark of admiration at the
gallant conduct of Sir James Saumarez, wrote the following letter to
the Secretary of the Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Government-house, Guernsey, 9th June 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I do myself the honour of transmitting herewith a copy of what I deemed proper
to insert this day in the public orders issued to his Majesty's forces stationed
on the island of Guernsey, under my command. May I request that this tribute of
well-earned approbation from a brother officer may be communicated to the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty. Should it appear irregular that an
extra-official communication of this nature comes from a department not
immediately under their lordships' cognizance, the impropriety on my part I
trust will be indulgently forgiven, as it arises from an irresistible impulse of
wishing to do justice to merit and exertions far indeed above my praise. As an
officer honoured with a public and confidential situation, and having from shore
been an eye-witness of the gallant intrepidity of Sir James Saumarez, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>and
sailors of his Majesty's ships Crescent, Druid, and Eurydice, under his command,
I consider it my duty to express, although still inadequately, my opinion of the
conduct of men whose modesty (the infallible concomitant of merit) may, in
reporting to you, come short of what thousands of loyal and anxious spectators
from this island beheld with joy and satisfaction, in the display of superior
address and British bravery alluded to.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to subscribe myself,<br />
<span class="i2">With esteem and high regard, sir,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Small.</span></p>
<p>To Philip Stephens, Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>N.B. The enclosure has been already given.</p></div>

<p>The following general memorandum was issued to the squadron, dated</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, Guernsey Roads, 9th June 1794.</p>
<p>General Memorandum.</p>

<p>Sir James Saumarez desires to return his best thanks to Captain Ellison, and the
officers and men of H.M.S. Druid, for their spirited conduct and bravery on the
8th instant, in having, jointly with the Crescent, repelled ships of the enemy
treble our force. It is to be regretted that the bad sailing of the Eurydice
prevented their deriving the advantage they otherwise would have received from
Captain Cole and his brave ship's company.</p>
<hr class="c15" />
<p class="p2 right">Crescent, Guernsey Roads, 9th June 1794.</p>
<p>General Memorandum.</p>

<p>Sir James Saumarez requests Captain Cole will signify to the officers and ship's
company of his Majesty's ship Eurydice, under his command, how truly mortified
he felt <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>himself at being deprived of their support and assistance on the 8th
instant, in consequence of the bad sailing of their ship. Had the enemy's force
on that day permitted their being brought to action on more equal terms, he is
too fully persuaded of the gallantry and bravery of British seamen not to be
convinced of its having been attended with the most signal success.</p></div>

<p>Early in the action, the small vessels, being separated by the enemy,
bore up for Plymouth. The Valiant arrived first with bad news; and
then Mr. Hall, of the Cockchafer, went to Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride, and
informed him that the whole of Sir James Saumarez' squadron was taken.
The admiral, who was then suffering under a fit of the gout, demanded
if he saw them strike; to which Mr. Hall replied that he did not, but
they could not escape. This so enraged the admiral, who would not
believe Sir James's squadron had been taken, that he threatened to
throw his crutch at him, and sent him out of his presence in a very
summary manner, charging him to return to Guernsey with the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Tuesday, 10th June.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>If I can gather anything right from Hall, of the little lugger that ran away
from you, this will find you at Guernsey, and I hope in good health, with your
associates; to whom remember me. The conduct of the small craft you are the best
judge of, and I shall suspend my conjectures till I see or hear from you on that
subject. As you must naturally have received damage, you will, I think, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>do well
to return hither, by which time I suppose La Margaretta will arrive. Yesterday
evening Sir Roger Curtis landed from the Phaeton. He left Lord Howe on the 4th.
I know not the particulars, but there has been a general action; and I think
Monsieur Jean Bon L'Andre and his Guillotine have had a thorough drubbing. We
have lost very few officers of rank. Lord Howe is perfectly well, of which I
give you joy.</p>
<p class="left60">Yours, my dear sir, most affectionately,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John M<sup>c</sup>Bride.</span></p></div>

<p>Meanwhile the commodore, in consequence of the enemy's motions,
wrote the following letter to the Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, Guernsey Road, 11th June 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have despatched the Active cutter to Spithead, to acquaint you, for the
information of their lordships, that the French squadron which engaged his
Majesty's ships under my command on Sunday last, put into Cancalle Bay the day
following. I have reason to believe they are part of the squadron that chased
this ship, in company with the Nymphe and Concorde, on the 2nd instant, off the
Seven Islands; and that the ships of the line that were then in company
proceeded to Brest.</p>

<p>His Majesty's ship Severn joined me this morning from Plymouth; and I propose to
proceed to the Sound to-morrow, in compliance with orders from Rear-admiral
M<sup>c</sup>Bride.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Philip Stephens, Esq. Secretary, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The squadron returned to Plymouth Sound on the 14th of June, when
Sir James sent the following letter to his brother:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Saturday, 14th June 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>We sailed from the island at four yesterday morning, unluckily too
soon for the arrival of the packet; by which I lost all the pretty
things you, with other friends, said to me on the business of last
Sunday. We remain also uninformed of Lord Howe's victory, except that
we know a general action has taken place favourable to us. This
evening will, I hope, clear up all our doubts.</p>

<p>The French squadron put into Cancalle Bay the day after our rencontre,
and I have reason to think were rather sore from our well-directed
fire. That their fire did not take more effect on the Crescent, must
be ascribed to a superior Providence; as, I will own to you, I never
saw shot fall thicker about any ship than at the time we hauled up for
Vason Bay.</p>

<p>My old pilot, Jean Breton, has infinite merit, and I must have him
recommended to that very laudable society for the encouragement of the
protection of the commerce of the country. He has a large family, to
whom any pecuniary recompense will be of service; but as two other
pilots exerted themselves, one on board the Druid, and the other in
this ship, I hope they will also be considered. Mention this to my
worthy friend the Lord Mayor, who will probably have the goodness to
undertake the business.</p>

<p>I am proceeding to Plymouth for further orders, and you may rest
assured of hearing from me when any thing is fixed. The Valiant lugger
has this instant joined me from Plymouth, and has brought me the
extraordinary Gazette; I most truly rejoice at the good news it
contains, though I am savage enough to wish a few more had been sunk
or taken.</p>

<p>This business absorbs all lesser considerations, and I must be
satisfied if I can only be considered the <span class="italic">horse-radish</span> to garnish
the roast beef.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Adieu, my worthy Richard: lose no time, as the Admiral writes to me we
shall sail again early next week. I hope to arrive in the Sound this
evening.</p>

<p class="left70">Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Sir James was, however, disappointed in receiving an answer from his
brother, being ordered to sail in command of a squadron. The following
letter concludes the account of the late meritorious affair:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Plymouth, Crescent, June 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>
<p>I have been much disappointed, not to receive a single line from you since we
sailed from this place, although I am convinced you must have written by way of
Guernsey. To-morrow I sail with a squadron of six frigates under my command,
viz. Crescent, Nymphe, Blonde, Druid, Concorde, and Severn: my only fear is,
that we shall not be so fortunate as to fall in with the enemy. Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride
has shown me his reply from the Admiralty to his letter, inclosing my account of
our late business off Guernsey. It is highly flattering to myself, and
expressive of their approbation of my conduct in the strongest terms. I doubt my
letter being published, as it is only in instances where success has been the
consequence.</p>

<p>What a noble business that of Lord Howe! And how well he has fulfilled the
expectations which those who knew him had formed of his character! Several of my
friends are here who were in that action, and speak in the highest strain of
panegyric of the whole of his conduct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>I wait for my wife being again on her legs to compose on the late victory. Why
have you not a turn for poetry and music, so as to indite a song on this
subject, in lieu of the famous <ins title="Corrected erratum: original reads 'Ninety-second'">Ninety-two</ins>., that has had the run of a whole
century?</p>

<p>Adieu, my worthy friend! I am truly and faithfully yours,</p>

<p>Captain Saumarez, whose conduct in his late encounter with the enemy's
squadron had called forth the admiration of his country, and the high
approbation of the Admiralty, was continued in command of the squadron
destined to protect the Channel islands. Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride emphatically
said, "their defence could not be in better hands." Sir James left
Plymouth on the 16th of June 1794, and arrived at Guernsey on the
following day. The enemy's large ships escaped to Brest before any
force could be brought to intercept them. The station of Saumarez was
from Cape Barfleur to the Seven Islands; and, on the English coast,
between the Isle of Wight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> and the Start, having four frigates under
his command. The following letter to his brother gives an amusing
account of a false alarm, occasioned by the squadron while his Majesty
George the Third was at Weymouth:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Crescent, 18th September 1794.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>I was made happy yesterday by the sight of your handwriting, of which I had for
a considerable time been deprived. You will have learnt from the Lord Mayor of
our short cruise off Cherbourg. On our return, Sunday evening, we caused an
alarm I had little expected: the Trusty, having fallen in with the four
frigates, made the private signal, which, not being distinctly seen, remained
unanswered. In consequence of which she proceeded to Weymouth Road, making
signals of an enemy. The troops were ordered under arms, the batteries manned,
and the royal carriages got in readiness. At our approach to the road after
dark, a shot was fired from the Trusty. This ship was secured with springs on
her cables, and was ready to pour her broadside, when I fortunately made the
night-signal, to denote we were friends. I immediately went on shore, and found
the royal family at the rooms, not without apprehension of the enemy's landing.</p>

<p>The King desired to see me, and very heartily laughed at the circumstance. I
remained near an hour in conference with their Majesties in the tea-room; a very
distinguished honour, I assure you, as even the lords in waiting are scarcely
ever admitted during meals: I was highly flattered at the very gracious and
flattering reception I met with. The next day they were on the water, and the
King expressed himself much satisfied with the man&oelig;uvres <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>of the squadron
under my directions. Lady S. and Mrs. Le Marchant, of Bath, were on board the
Crescent, and I was happy in the company of Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;. All dined on board,
and seemed well satisfied with the day.</p>

<p>I expect Admiral M<sup>c</sup>Bride the beginning of next week; at which time we shall
either go to Plymouth or Portsmouth, to complete our provisions. The weather is
so bad that we must not expect the packet from Guernsey, and it prevents the one
from Weymouth putting to sea. Love to my sister and children.</p>
<p class="left70">Yours most affectionately,</p>
<p class="right">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The Crescent continued on Channel service until the 10th of October,
when she returned to Cawsand Bay; and, after a short cruise in the
entrance of the Channel, she came to Plymouth to be refitted on the
4th of November. On the 8th she was taken into dock, not having been
coppered since 1784. Sir James had now an opportunity of enjoying
repose for two months, (his ship being in course of repair,) till the
15th of January 1795, when he was immediately attached to the grand
fleet under Earl Howe.</p>

<p>The following instructions will show the nature of the arduous service
on which Saumarez was destined to be employed for a considerable time:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">
Instructions for the conduct of ships appointed to obtain intelligence of the
state of the enemy's naval force at Brest.</p>


<p>Two frigates, supported by one or more ships <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>of the line, will be most
generally appointed for obtaining intelligence of the enemy's naval force, from
time to time, when the wind has been favourable to their fleet, or detachment
thereof, to put to sea. The frigates so appointed are meant to stretch from
Ushant inward to the Black Rocks, together or in succession, as requisite for
their mutual support, and better means of communicating with the covering ships;
and off St. Matthew's Point, or so as to discover whether the enemy's fleet are
still in Brest water, and, if easily practicable, the number and situation of
the enemy's ships of war there, and in the adjacent anchoring bays without the
Goulet. The covering ships of the line, it is supposed, will generally answer
the purpose of their appointment by keeping off, or a little within, the Black
Rocks, whilst the frigates are advanced to the more eastern situation before
mentioned. The several captains so employed are, nevertheless, to be governed on
this service by the state of the weather and movements of the enemy, as they see
best in their discretion, or may be directed by the commanding officer, for
being able to get to sea with facility when necessary for the purpose of this
appointment; and, having made the intended discovery, they are to return for
reporting observations to me with all convenient despatch. They are to observe,
that the capture of single ships of the line or frigates, or any action with the
enemy not absolutely requisite for the security of their ships, is not an object
of equal moment to compensate for any delay in conveying the earliest
information to me, by signal or personal intercourse, of the state or motions of
the enemy as aforesaid. The ordering of the fleet in their absence on this
service will be calculated for arriving off Ushant as early as possible the next
morning, on these occasions if the detached ships should not have joined the
fleet the preceding day, in view to take advantage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> every opportunity to
intercept the ships of the enemy attempting to put to sea from Brest. And as it
may be requisite often to renew this appointment, the intention will be
expressed by signal No. 181, together with the particular signals (one or more)
of the ships of the line and frigates then meant to be so employed; and the
signal No. 124 will be subsequently made when the ships are to part company from
the fleet for such purpose.</p>

<p>To Sir James Saumarez,<br />
<span class="left5">Captain H.M.S. Crescent.</span></p></div>

<p>On this occasion Sir James Saumarez wrote the following letter to his
brother, which shows the high opinion entertained of his services off
the Black Rocks by his lordship:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Spithead, 15th January 1795.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of yours yesterday morning, and have only time to acquaint
you that part of the fleet are now dropping down to St. Helen's, and to-morrow
we hope to put to sea. The wind is far to the southward, but I hope we shall be
able to get down Channel before it comes to the westward. There can be little
doubt but the enemy's fleet are still at sea. If we have the good fortune to
meet them, the business will be glorious for the country.</p>

<p>Our line consists of thirty-five, ten of which are three-deckers. The French
have only thirty-two, and four only of three-deckers. My situation in the fleet
(repeating frigate) is certainly more desirable than a less conspicuous one; at
the same time, I would rather command a seventy-four. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>Lord Howe is remarkably
gracious, and has overwhelmed me with compliments in his opinion of my merits. I
have the more to accomplish in order to show myself deserving of it. Be assured
of my zealous endeavours. Adieu! Give my sincere love to my sister and dear
children.</p>
<p class="left65">I am ever affectionately yours,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez</p></div>

<p>Sir James always preferred the command of a ship of the line to a
frigate, notwithstanding the chances of prize-money are in favour of
the latter. He accordingly made the following application to the First
Lord of the Admiralty; and it will be seen, by the subsequent
correspondence, that his wishes were complied with.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I beg leave to acquaint your lordship, that some time since I made application
to be appointed to a line-of-battle ship, and the Earl of Chatham was pleased to

esteem myself greatly obliged to your lordship to appoint me to one, and at the
same time to permit me to take my officers and ship's company.</p>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging your letter to be appointed to
a line-of-battle ship. I am not at present apprised of there being an immediate
opportunity to comply with your request; but it will give me <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>great pleasure to
have an early one afforded me of promoting an officer of so much acknowledged
merit.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I beg to avail myself of the return of the fleet into port, to remind your

line-of-battle ship; and as the Orion is likely soon to become vacant, I shall
be greatly obliged to your lordship to have the goodness to give me the command
of her, and at the same time to permit me to take my officers and ship's

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>
I beg to express my sincere acknowledgments to your lordship for having been

<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p>
<p>Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Sir James remained with the Channel fleet until the 13th of March,
when, at his own request,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> he was removed into his Majesty's ship
Orion. The whole crew of the Crescent volunteered to follow him, and
his application for them was in part complied with; as also for
Lieutenants Otter and Rye, and some of the warrant and petty officers,
who were consequently turned over to that ship, which was fitting at
Portsmouth. As it would be a considerable time before she could be
refitted so as to be ready for sea, Captain Saumarez was, at the
special application of the admiral, Lord Hugh Seymour, appointed (pro
tempore) to the Marlborough of seventy-four guns, and attached to a
detachment of the grand fleet under the Honourable W. Waldegrave,
(afterwards Lord Radstock,) cruising between Ushant and Cape
Finisterre. His appointment was dated 19th March 1795. On the 8th of
April he became senior officer of the detached squadron off the
Western Isles, under the orders of Lord Bridport. He returned on the
8th of June to take command of his own ship, the Orion, which had been
fitted out by Captain Donnelly, and was now ready to receive orders
for sea. He was now again placed under the orders of his lordship, the
commander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, and sailed on the 12th of
June, two days after his arrival. On the 22nd, the squadron fell in
with the enemy off L'Orient at daylight, at which time the Orion was
one of the sternmost ships when the signal was made to chase. Her
captain soon gave a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> manifest proof of his zeal and abilities on this
occasion. She was, before morning of the 23rd, the headmost ship of
the fleet; and, before six o'clock, was the first which actually began
the action with one of the enemy's largest ships.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of Lord Bridport's official despatch:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Royal George, at sea, 24th June 1795.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>It is with sincere satisfaction I acquaint you, for the information of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, that his Majesty's squadron under my command
attacked the enemy's fleet, consisting of twelve ships of the line, attended
with eleven frigates and some smaller cruisers, on the 23rd instant, close in
with the port of L'Orient. The ships which struck are the Alexander, Le
Formidable, and Le Tigre, which were with difficulty retained. If the enemy had
not been protected and sheltered by the land, I have every reason to believe
that a much greater number, if not all the line-of-battle ships, would have been
taken or destroyed.</p>

<p>In detailing the particulars of this service, I am to state that at the dawn of
day, on the 22nd instant, the Nymphe and Astrea, being the look-out frigates
ahead, made the signal for the enemy's fleet. I soon perceived there was no
intention to meet me in battle; consequently, I made the signal for four of the
best-sailing ships, the Sanspareil, Orion, Russell, and Colossus, and, soon
afterwards, the whole fleet, to chase; which continued all day and the whole
night with very little wind.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 23rd, the headmost ships, the Orion, Irresistible,
Queen Charlotte, Russell, Colossus, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>and Sanspareil, were pretty well up with
the enemy; and a little before six o'clock the action began, and continued till
near nine. When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some
batteries, and in the face of a strong naval port, which will manifest to the
public the zeal, intrepidity, and skill of the admirals, captains, and all the
other officers and seamen, and soldiers, employed upon this service; and they
are fully entitled to my warmest acknowledgments.</p>

<p>I beg also to be allowed to mark my approbation in a particular manner of
Captain Domett's conduct, serving under my flag, for his manly spirit, and for
the assistance I received from his active and attentive mind. I feel great
satisfaction in doing justice to the meritorious conduct of all the officers of
every class, as well as to the bravery of the seamen and soldiers in the Royal
George, upon this event and on former occasions.</p>

<p>I judged it necessary, upon the information I received of the force of the
enemy, to put the Robust, Thunderer, and Standard into my line of battle; but
their distance from my squadron, and there being little wind, prevented them
from joining me till after the action was over.</p>

<p>I shall proceed upon my station as soon as I have ordered a distribution of the
prisoners, and made other necessary arrangements for the squadron. It is my
intention to keep at sea, in order to fulfil every part of my instructions.</p>
<p class="left75">I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To Evan Nepean, Esq.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p><p>The enemy made their escape into L'Orient. By some accounts the
commander-in-chief has been blamed for not continuing the action; but
this does not seem to have been the opinion of Sir James Saumarez, who
wrote the following letter to his brother on the day after the action.
It is said that the fleet were not supplied with pilots for that part
of the coast.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, at sea, 24th June 1795.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>I have the satisfaction to acquaint you that, last Monday, we fell in with the
French fleet, about eighteen leagues from the Isle de Groix. The signal for a
general chase was made at six o'clock; but, having little wind, we were still at
a considerable distance from them in the evening. Our headmost ships denoted by
signal that they consisted of fourteen sail of the line and eleven frigates. The
admiral made the signal to engage the enemy on coming up with them. It was with
great delight I found the Orion sail extremely well, and in the morning we were
one of the headmost ships of the squadron. I should observe, that Sir John
Warren's convoy were in sight at the time we first saw the enemy; and a vessel
was detached to order the Robust and Thunderer to join us, which made our number
nineteen sail of the line.</p>

<p>The French fleet at daylight was about five miles from us, crowding all sail,
and steering for their coast, which appeared in sight. At five o'clock, this
ship, being ahead of the Queen Charlotte, began the action, and kept up a
constant fire as we came up; which was warmly returned by the enemy's sternmost
ships, one of which was the Montagne. Finding I could go to windward of one of
their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ships, I hauled up between her and their fleet, and gave her our larboard
guns directly for her stern. She was afterwards attacked by other ships, to
which she struck, and proved to be the Alexander.</p>

<p>The Irresistible, Russell, Colossus, and Sanspareil were the headmost of our
fleet after the Orion and Queen Charlotte, and engaged the enemy as they came
up. A French seventy-four, that had taken fire on the poop, struck to the
frigates. She is called the Formidable, and is not materially damaged from the
fire. When the Queen, London, and finally the Royal George, came into action,
they kept up a most amazing fire; but by this time the enemy were within three
miles of their coast, and they all escaped except the Tigre, which struck to the
Royal George.</p>

<p>For further details I must refer you to the public accounts. Our loss in this
ship has been inconsiderable when I assure you we were engaged with very little
intermission the whole time of the action, which lasted four hours. We have four
killed, two since dead, and eighteen wounded. The ship has suffered more in
proportion in the hull, masts, and sails. We regret not to have had a few
leagues' more space, as none could then have escaped. Port Louis, near L'Orient,
has afforded them this timely shelter, but not till they had a severe drubbing.</p>

<p>You will show the contents of this letter to Mr. Le Mesurier, as I have scarcely
one moment to spare.</p>

<p>Adieu! Remember me most kindly to my sister; and believe me truly, my dear
Richard,</p>
<p class="left70">Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>
<p>You will oblige Lady S. by inclosing this, after perusal, to her.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>This detachment of the Channel fleet, which was destined to protect
the ill-fated expedition to Quiberon Bay, under Sir J. B. Warren,
continued for some time on the coast; but the Orion, being one of the
ships which had suffered most, was ordered to Portsmouth. On his
arrival, Sir James wrote the following letter to his brother Richard.</p>

<p class="right">Orion, off St. Helens, 12th July 1795.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Brother,</p>

<p>I take the earliest opportunity to acquaint you, that I parted from the fleet
last Thursday, with the Charon, hospital ship, which I saw safe into Portland
this morning: Captain Grindall, (the only captain wounded,) who took his passage
on board her, was much recovered. On the day I left the fleet, Admiral
Cornwallis, with the ships under his command, joined Lord Bridport; and I
imagine the Queen Charlotte, with the ships that suffered most in the action,
will go home. As the Orion requires a new fore-mast and bowsprit, besides
considerable repair, I take it for granted she will be ordered into harbour.</p>

<p>A few days after the action we were alarmed by the appearance of an epidemic
fever on board; but, by sending the men infected on board the hospital ship, and
using timely precaution, I am happy to say it has entirely subsided, but it gave
me a great degree of concern: added to this, we have had the small-pox on board;
but it has been of so favourable a kind, that the men who have had it are all
doing well, two excepted, who died on board the hospital ship. Several are now
under inoculation, and I hope will recover.</p>

<p>We have lost eight men in consequence of the action: all <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>the wounded, except
two, are nearly well; their wounds, I am happy to find, were slight.</p>

<p>It will have surprised you to find me differ in my statement of the action from
the Admiral, when I mention having begun the action. The fact was, the
Irresistible fired two, or, I believe, three bow-guns, but I never could
consider that entitling her to being the first in action; <span class="italic">but of this hereafter</span>.</p>

<p>Now is a good opportunity for you and my sister to come and spend a few days at
Portsmouth, if you can spare time to undertake the journey. Come down
immediately, and take a sail in the ship into Portsmouth Harbour. I was in great
hope to be in time to see Lady S. this evening, but I fear it is impossible; it
is near eight o'clock, and we are no nearer than St. Helen's Road, with little
wind. I have heard from none of my friends during the cruise, so that I know not
what became of you after your peregrination to St. Helens.</p>

<p>The prizes left the fleet ten days ago, and must be expected the first westerly
winds. You will be glad to hear that Mr. Otter is promoted.</p>

<p class="left70">Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>

<p>P.S. Portsmouth, 15th July 1795. I have only time to acquaint you with my being
just landed. Let me hear from you. Adieu!</p></div>

<p>We here give a diagram of this action at the time it began. When the
Irresistible fired her bow-guns, she was in <span class="italic">chase</span>, astern and not up
alongside of the enemy; but the Orion reserved all her fire until
actually alongside; she was certainly the first that could bring all
her broadside to bear on one of the enemy's ships, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> therefore
justly claims the honour of having commenced the battle. But Sir James
took no steps to correct the statement, and was, as usual, content
with being included in the mass of those who distinguished themselves
on that occasion.</p>

<p>The Orion was taken into Portsmouth harbour, and, as six weeks were
required to repair her damages, Sir James had another month's
relaxation from actual service. It was the 18th July before she was
reported ready for sea. On the 21st he wrote the following letter to
his brother, describing the service on which he was now to be
employed:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Ryde, 21st August 1795.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>Expecting to sail from day to day, I delayed writing till I could acquaint you
with the precise time of our departure. This morning the wind proved easterly,
but it has again veered to the westward, and become as uncertain as ever, so
that I yet hope to hear from you. I understand that about four thousand troops,
<span class="italic">British</span>, and fifteen hundred emigrants, sail under our escort. They are
commanded by General Doyle, and it is supposed are destined to take possession
of Noirmoutier, to keep up communication with Charrette's army. Monsieur, who
you know is embarked on board the Jason, accompanies them. It is to be hoped
that this last effort of ours to secure a footing on their own territory to
these unfortunate people, will prove successful; I say this last, for, from what
I learn, Lord Moira resigns with the whole of his staff, and the rest of his
army are to be, under command of Sir R. Abercromby, destined for the West
Indies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>We are likely to have enough on our hands should war be continued, as it is
impossible but we must have the Spanish to contend with. Several ships sailed
this morning to reinforce our squadron in the North Seas, which shows the Dutch
are beginning to stir themselves.</p>

<p>I write from Ryde, where Lady S. has been since yesterday, being near Spithead,
where I must be every day. As the wind is at present, there is every reason to
expect that we shall be here some days longer; therefore write to me. Adieu! God
bless you all!</p>
<p class="left65">I am truly and affectionately yours,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The expedition, alluded to in the above letter, was placed under
command of Rear-admiral Henry Harvey, and consisted of the Prince of
Wales (flag-ship), Queen Charlotte, Prince, Orion, Russell, Arethusa,
and Jason, with a convoy of one hundred and twenty-six vessels. These
were detained at Spithead till the end of September; and on the 13th
of October they reached Isle Dieu, where they were destined to
co-operate with the former expedition. When off Hedic, Admiral Harvey
sent the Orion to join Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, with that
part of the convoy intended to act with the royalists, while he
proceeded with the rest to the West Indies.</p>

<p>The troops were landed. The Orion was employed blockading the coast
near Rochfort and L'Orient; the nature of which memorable service will
be best understood from the following letters from Sir James to his
brother.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, at sea, 26th October.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>
<p>I have just learnt from the Admiral, that he intends to despatch the Porcupine
for England, which gives me an opportunity of writing a line merely to acquaint
you of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>our being in existence, but most deucedly tired of our cruise: nothing
worthy our notice has occurred since my last letter. Sir John Warren left
Quiberon Bay last Wednesday for Noirmoutier, whence it is supposed the emigrants
will join Charrette's army. We pay frequent visits to our friends in Port Louis.
They continue nearly in the same state as when we left them after the 23rd of
June; and, from the intelligence we have obtained, they are not in any
forwardness for sea, being without stores or men.</p>

<p>We experienced hitherto remarkable fine weather, which I hope will continue; but
nothing can equal our unvaried scene, fixed to this confounded spot, without the
least prospect of anything falling in our way. We have not even the advantage of
hearing from England; for, sparingly, two ships only have joined us from
Plymouth since we are on this station. In short, my dear friend, I am heartily
tired of so inactive a situation, and shall very sincerely rejoice to be
relieved from it. You are much more likely to receive accounts of the expedition
than we are, having but little intercourse with the army, and that little is
solely confined to the Admiral, who deals out the news very <span class="italic">cautiously</span>. Could we
but hear from our friends, it would yield us some comfort; but that we are also
denied: it is, however, some satisfaction we can let them know we are alive. God
bless you! and believe me, with my kindest love to my dear sister and children,</p>
<p class="left70"> Yours most affectionately,</p>

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Orion, Houat, 26th November 1795.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>We sailed from Isle Dieu this day, subsequent to my letter by the Thunderer; and
various have been the decisions respecting withdrawing the troops from that
island. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>On Monday, Sir John Warren sailed with the Robust, Theseus, and four
frigates, with the intention of making the embarkation; but it came on to blow
so strong that they were obliged to put back. I was dispensed with from that
service, by having been appointed to carry on the communication with the
royalists, for the purpose of conveying to them the immense supply of stores and
ammunition intended for them, besides about thirty thousand pounds in specie.
The 24th was the day fixed for their being landed, and General George was to
muster all his force to receive them, at a place called Bitiers, at the entrance
of the Villaine; but the weather proved so boisterous on that and the following
day, that there existed no possibility of any communication.</p>

<p>Sir John Warren, to my great satisfaction, joined me this morning with the
frigates; the embarkation from Isle Dieu having at last been given up. To-morrow
we hope to hear that our friends occupy the post agreed on; and we shall throw
them as speedily as possible, by means of the chasse-mar&eacute;es and boats of the
squadron, the various articles in our possession which they so much want.</p>

<p>The last letters I have received were dated the 19th: they mention P&mdash;&mdash;
being under arrest; but there was a difference of opinion respecting him, which
was submitted to Monsieur. As his Royal Highness is gone home, it will be some
time before his fate is decided. Being informed that the Standard was ordered
for England, I would not lose the opportunity, and in some way I hope to inform
you with the successful result of our enterprise: once ended, I hope we shall
bend our steps homeward.</p>

<p>Our friend Dan, with Phil. Dumaresq, are perfectly well. Remember me with
kindest love to my sister, and believe me ever affectionately yours,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<p>The details of the failure of this expedition need not be dwelt upon;
it was finally determined on the 13th of December to withdraw the
troops, and Sir James Saumarez consequently received the following
order:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>By Henry Harvey, Esq. Rear-admiral of the Red, &amp;c.<br />
<span class="left5">To Sir James Saumarez, Captain of H.M.S. Orion.</span></p>

<p>You are hereby required and directed to take under your convoy all the
transports, store-ships, victuallers, and other vessels lying in this bay, and
put to sea in company with his Majesty's squadron under my command. You will
have under your direction his Majesty's ship Porcupine, whose captain is
directed to follow your orders. You are to use your utmost endeavours to keep
company with me; but, in case of separation, make the best of your way to
Spithead, leaving off Plymouth such of the victuallers as may have sailed from
that port.</p>
<p>Given under my hand, on board the<br />
Prince of Wales, 17th December<br />
1795, Houat Roads.</p>
<p class="right smcap">H. Harvey.</p></div>

<p>Admiral Harvey parted from the convoy off Brest, and Sir James arrived
at Spithead, after having looked into Brest, on the 30th December, and
reported his arrival to the Secretary of the Admiralty; to which he
received the following answer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Orion was ordered into harbour; and on examination it was found
she had been so much strained during the last cruise, particularly in
the November storm, subsequently known by the name of "Admiral
Christian's gale," besides having sprung her lower masts, that it
became absolutely necessary for her to be taken into dock. During the
next four months Sir James obtained, leave of absence; and it was not
until the 7th of May 1796, that, having rejoined his ship, he was
called into active service, the Orion being placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> in Rear-admiral
Lord Hugh Seymour's division of the grand fleet which was fitted for
foreign service.</p>

<p>After a short cruise off Brest, the Orion proceeded to reinforce the
fleet under Sir John Jervis, off Cape St. Vincent. This squadron
consisted of the Sanspareil (flag-ship), Orion, Triumph, Juste,
Hector, and Theseus, of the line; Phaeton and Latona, frigates; and
Incendiary, fire-ship. On arriving off their station, Captain Saumarez
was detached to Fayall by Lord Hugh's order, dated the 13th June, to
obtain stock, wine, &amp;c. for the use of the squadron; and was directed
to meet his lordship at ten leagues to the westward of that island;
after which the squadron returned to Cape St. Vincent, and from
thence, in the month of September, they joined the Channel fleet,
under Lord Gardner.</p>

<p>On the 11th of December the Orion returned to Spithead, in order to
refit and replenish in water and provisions, after a six months'
unsuccessful cruise. This occupied but a short time; and on the 17th
of the same month Sir James proceeded in the Orion, with a squadron
under the orders of Admiral W. Parker, to reinforce Sir John Jervis,
off Cape St. Vincent. This squadron consisted of the Prince George,
98; Namur, 90; Irresistible, Orion, and Colossus, of 74 guns; and
Thalia frigate. The junction with Sir John was effected on the 6th of
February.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> Thus reinforced, the Admiral had under his command&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John Jervis was well aware that the Spanish fleet might be nearly
double his force, but he kept working up towards the position where he
expected to meet them. On the 13th, in the morning, the Minerve,
Captain Cockburn, bearing the broad pendant of Commodore Nelson,
(which was afterwards shifted to the Captain, 74) having on board Sir
Gilbert Elliot, late viceroy of Corsica and others, came into the
fleet with intelligence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> that on the 11th, soon after quitting
Gibraltar, she had been chased by two Spanish line-of-battle ships;
and that afterwards, when in the mouth of the Straits, she got sight
of the Spanish fleet. Before sunset the signals were made for the
British fleet to prepare for battle, and to keep in close order all
the night, during which the signal-guns of the Spaniards were
distinctly heard. At half-past two, A.M. the Portuguese frigate
Carlotta spoke the Victory; and her captain (Campbell) gave
information that the Spanish grand fleet, commanded by Don Josef de
Cordova, was only five leagues to windward; that they had sailed from
Carthagena on the 1st of the month, and consisted of twenty-eight sail
of the line, viz.</p>

<p>There were also twelve frigates, some gun-boats, and seventy
transports with troops, which were disembarked at Algesiras.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not positively known what the destination of this powerful fleet
was; some accounts say Cadiz, others Brest. It is, however, certain
that their admiral did not expect to meet more than ten or twelve sail
of the line with Sir John Jervis, and that he anticipated an easy
capture, and a triumphant entry into port with his prizes. His dismay
may therefore be easily imagined at seeing the English fleet of
fifteen sail of the line close to him, in excellent order of battle,
while his own fleet was in such a scattered situation as to render it
impossible to prevent his intrepid enemy from cutting off a group
which had separated from the main body of his fleet, and which in vain
attempted to rejoin by crowding all sail.</p>

<p>As it is not our intention to enter into the particulars of this
memorable battle, excepting as regards the Orion, an extract from the
admiral's despatch will be sufficient to show the bold and decisive
step which he took on that occasion, and by which he succeeded in
obtaining a most glorious victory over double his force.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Victory, Lagos Bay, 16th February 1797.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>The hope of falling in with the Spanish fleet, expressed in my letter to you of
the 13th instant, was confirmed last night by distinctly hearing the report of
their signal-guns, and by intelligence received from Captain Foote, of his
Majesty's ship Niger, who had, with equal judgment and perseverance, kept
company with them for several days, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> my prescribed rendezvous, (which, from
the strong S.E. wind, I had never been able to reach,) and that they were not
more than the distance of three or four leagues from us.</p>

<p>I anxiously waited the dawn of day; when, being on the starboard tack, Cape St.
Vincent bearing E.N.E. eight leagues, I had the satisfaction of seeing a number
of ships extended from S.W. to S., the wind then W. by S. At forty-nine minutes
past ten, the weather being extremely hazy, La Bonne Citoyenne made the signal
that the ships seen were of the line, twenty-five in number.</p>

<p> His Majesty's squadron under my command, consisting of fifteen ships of the
line, happily formed in the most compact order of sailing in two lines. By
carrying a press of sail, I was fortunate in getting in with the enemy's fleet
at half-past eleven, before it had time to collect and form a regular order of
battle. Such a moment was not to be lost; and, confident in the skill, valour,
and discipline of the officers and men I had the happiness to command, and
judging that the honour of his Majesty's arms, and the circumstances of the war
in these seas, required a considerable degree of enterprise, I felt myself
justified in departing from the regular system; and, passing through their fleet
in a line formed with the utmost celerity, tacked, and thereby separated
one-third from the main body. After a partial cannonade, which prevented their
rejunction till the evening, and by the very great exertions of the ships which
had the good fortune to arrive up with the enemy on the larboard tack, the ships
named in the margin<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> were captured, and the action ceased about five o'clock.</p></div>

<p>That the Orion was one of those ships which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> distinguished themselves
will best appear from the private letter of her brave commander to his
brother, written only the day after the action; a circumstance which
cannot but give such a communication a value far superior to a more
elaborate composition. The log also of his ship, written at the time
by the master, to which we have had access, completely accords with
the facts so clearly stated in the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, Lagos Bay, 15th February 1797.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>You will be happy to receive an account from me of the important victory
obtained by our squadron over the Spanish fleet, consisting of nearly double our
force. The Admiral having received previous information of their sailing from
Carthagena, and of their cruising off the entrance of the Straits, gave us
timely notice of the intelligence by the signal to prepare for battle.</p>

<p>Early on Tuesday morning, the weather being hazy, with light winds, the frigates
on the look-out made the signal for discovering the enemy, and soon after we
discerned several ships to leeward, and the body of the fleet to windward. We
were then on the starboard tack, standing to the southward. The signal was made
to different ships to chase; and, shortly after, for the fleet to form in line
of battle as most convenient. The enemy at this time were bearing down to join
their ships to leeward; but we came upon them so fast, that, before they could
effect the junction, the headmost ships, which were the Culloden, Prince George,
Orion, Blenheim, and Colossus, with the Victory and the rest coming up, it was
effectually <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>prevented. They then hauled their wind on the larboard tack, and
our Admiral made the signal for the fleet to tack. Our sternmost ships then
became the headmost.</p>

<p>Commodore Nelson, who had joined from Elba the day before, shifted his pendant
to the Captain, the leading ship, and distinguished himself most eminently. The
Culloden, Blenheim, Prince George, and Orion, were the next that came up, and
were warmly engaged for nearly three hours with the body of the enemy's fleet,
who had not had the time, or address, to form into any order. But it is only
doing them justice to say, they defended themselves very bravely.</p>

<p>We were, for above an hour, opposed to a three-decker, the Salvador del Mundo,
which finally struck to this ship; we lowered the boat from the stern, and gave
orders to Mr. Luce, the first lieutenant, to take possession of her; still
making sail for the other ships, and following Admiral Parker in the Prince
George. The Excellent, which had passed us to windward, had made a
line-of-battle ship, the San Domingo, strike some time before this.</p>

<p>Several ships of the enemy were extremely shattered in their masts and sails;
but, keeping up a warm fire on their ships, the Captain laid one of them, the
San Nicolas, an eighty-four, on board, and hauled down her colours. A
three-decker, the San Josef, wishing, I believe, to rescue the ship, got on
board of her, and gave Commodore Nelson an opportunity of also hauling down her
colours. His bravery on this occasion is above all praise.</p>

<p>The Namur and other ships had by this time joined the van, and engaged as they
came up. I stood for a three-decker, which, after engaging some time, struck her
colours: she first had showed a white flag, which, though I concluded to
indicate a truce, was not satisfactory to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>myself, and we continued firing till
they hoisted an English flag over the Spanish, on which we ceased firing.</p>

<p>The enemy's ships, many of which had not been in action, at this time came up
and were forming to windward. The Admiral made the signal to wear and come to
the wind on the starboard tack; wishing, I believe, to keep his squadron
collected near the prizes, as well as the Captain, that was much disabled,
besides the Colossus, which ship very unfortunately lost her fore-yard very
early in the action. This ill-timed, but doubtless necessary man&oelig;uvre,
lost us the additional triumph of having the Purissima Concepcion, to grace the
ships already in our possession, and I experienced the regret of again seeing
her resume the Spanish colours.</p>

<p>I have here related to you facts as they really occurred, and I believe all my
officers will vouch for the authenticity of this account. I am happy to acquaint
you that we have providentially lost no man in the action; eight only wounded,
all doing well; amongst which number is Mr. Mansell, from a contusion in his
right shoulder by splinter. Our main and mizen top-masts are alone disabled, and
the hull has not suffered materially. All the officers, and every man
individually, behaved as nobly as I have ever witnessed; and you know it is not
the first action in which I have seen courage excited.</p>

<p>This is copied from the letter I write to my brother. My amanuensis is a
gentleman who acted as my aide-de-camp, and I beg you will acquaint his good
father that he acquitted himself highly to my satisfaction, and showed himself
deserving the stock from which he sprung. I truly hope in due time to have the
opportunity of advancing a young man of his merit.</p>

<p>In case I have not time to write to my brother, as the above has been copied
only from the scraps of the letter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>I intended writing, send him this letter,
stating my great hurry and the pressure of service at this crisis.</p>

<p>Adieu! nothing can equal my impatience to hear from you, and to receive good
accounts of my sister.</p>

<p class="left60">I am truly, most affectionately yours,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p>

<p class="right">Lagos Bay, 17th February 1797.</p>

<p>The principal cause of my present haste is my anxiety attending the care of the
San Josef, which we have in tow, and which has delayed us more than I can
express, these twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>N.B. I since have found it was the Santissima Trinidada, and not the Concepcion,
that struck, but afterwards got off. And the St. Ysidro, 74 guns, and not the
Santa Domingo, that is captured. The Santissima Trinidada is reported to be off
here by one of our frigates.</p></div>

<p>The enemy, however, passed Lagos Bay, leaving the prizes unmolested.
As the further details, and Spanish account of this action, will be
found in the Appendix, we shall proceed by giving the copies of the
following letters.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="p2 right">Victory, Lagos Bay, 16th February 1797.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>No language I am possessed of can convey the high sense I entertain of the
exemplary conduct of the flag-officers, captains, officers, seamen, marines, and
soldiers embarked on board every ship of the squadron I have the honour to
command, present at the vigorous and successful attack made upon the fleet of
Spain on the 14th instant. The signal advantage obtained by his Majesty's arms
on that day is entirely owing to their determined valour and discipline; and I
request you will accept yourself, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>and give my thanks and approbation to those
composing the crew of the ship under your command.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i2">Your most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right">J. <span class="smcap">Jervis.</span></p>
<p>To Captain Sir James Saumarez, Orion.</p></div>

<p>In consequence of this glorious victory, obtained, under Providence,
by the valour and discipline of the crews of his Majesty's ships on
the 14th February 1797, the commander-in-chief was pleased to grant a
free pardon to James Maloney, seaman, then under sentence of death for
repeated desertion from H.M.S. Speedy, which was communicated in the
most impressive manner to the fleet.</p>

<p>We cannot but remark that, in the various accounts of this action,
justice has been but barely done to the commander of the Orion, who is
only mentioned as one of the six captains who prevented the junction
of the enemy's separated squadron. If any act of heroism displayed on
that occasion was designed to be particularly recorded in the public
despatches, surely the fact that the Orion was the last ship that
engaged and took possession of the Salvador del Mundo, and then made
the Santissima Trinidada strike her colours and hoist the English flag
over the Spanish, deserves a place. For these achievements we have the
undoubted testimonies, not only of the gallant commander and the
officers of the ship,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> viz. Sir John Savage, Captains Tancock and
Mansell, but also that of one of the officers of the Spanish ship who
was on board at the time, and who added, that "we did not surrender
until all further defence was hopeless." The Orion could not send a
boat to her, because she had already taken possession of the Salvador,
on board which ship she had sent her first lieutenant and as many men
as she could spare, and also because she had no boat that could swim:
but this, it appeared, raised some doubts on the subject; and on a
subsequent occasion, when the captains met on board the Victory,
Commodore Nelson said, "It <span class="italic">was true</span>, Saumarez, that the Santissima
struck to you; the Spanish officers have acknowledged it." Sir James,
supposing from the manner in which this was spoken that Nelson had
doubted the truth of his report, answered rather sharply, "Who ever
doubted it, sir? I hope there is no need for such evidence to
establish the truth of the report of a British officer."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Luce's description of the state he found the Salvador in
was appalling in the extreme.&mdash;There were more than fifty lying on the
decks with wounds requiring amputation. In many instances the Spanish
surgeon, after having separated the limb, omitted to tie up the
arteries; consequently, on removing the tourniquet, the victim in a
few minutes bled to death: and the English sailors, who at length
stopped his merciless hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> were with difficulty prevented from
throwing him overboard with those he had butchered.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Luce was one of the officers promoted, in consequence of
this battle, to the rank of master and commander.</p>

<p>The fleet now returned to Lisbon, where the conquerors were received
with every demonstration of joy and gratitude. The English factory
presented a congratulatory address; and at this place the thanks of
both houses of parliament were communicated to them; and a third time
to Sir James, as one of the most distinguished captains. At the same
time he received from Earl Spencer and Lord Hugh Seymour the following
handsome letters of congratulation:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I congratulate you most sincerely on your having been present at the most
brilliant action which our naval history records, and on having had so
distinguished a share in it.</p>

<p class="left55">I am, dear sir, with great truth,<br />
<span class="left5">Your very obedient, humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right">Admiralty, 8th March 1797.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Spencer.</span></p>
<p>Sir James Saumarez.</p>

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>I congratulate you most heartily on your having had another opportunity of
displaying your merit, and on the share which you bore in the most brilliant
action that ever was achieved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope that I need not assure you how much I have shared with your friends the
satisfaction your conduct has given them; the reward for which, I hope, you will

you.</p>

<p>Admiralty, March 10th, 1797.</p></div>

<p>Early in March the Orion was again ready for active service; and the
following letter gives an account of the departure of Sir James
Saumarez with Commodore Nelson on a cruize.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, off the Tagus, 6th March 1797.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of your letter by packet, and I have to tell you we are now
actually under sail, with Commodore Nelson, in the Irresistible, the Leander,
and some frigates, going to intercept several Spanish ships expected from Vera
Cruz with rich cargoes. Be not surprised if, with our <span class="italic">desperate</span> commodore, you
hear of our taking the whole Spanish fleet, should we fall in with them. Our
cruise is expected to last only three weeks.</p>

<p>I hope on our return to receive letters from my friends, in reply to those I
sent by the Lively. I shall thank you, when you see our friends in Walbrook, if
you will mention to them that all my brother officers are extremely incensed at
the opinion given by Sir William Scott on the case of the Kingston; and we hope
he will have found reason to alter it. It is the circumstance, and not the value
of the salvage, that has displeased us so much.</p>

<p>We are just going over the Bar, so I must conclude <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>with my sincere and best
wishes for health and every happiness to attend you, my dear sister and family,</p>

<p class="left65">I am ever, my dear Richard,<br />
<span class="left10">Affectionately yours,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>This short cruize was, however, an unsuccessful one; and the commodore
had not yet an opportunity of displaying his valour. They returned to
Lisbon, and found that their commander-in-chief had become Earl St.
Vincent, and that Nelson had received the grand cross of the Bath;
while Saumarez was among those on whom was bestowed a gold medal for
their gallant conduct on Valentine's Day.</p>

<p>A reinforcement had now arrived from England; and the whole fleet,
consisting of twenty-one sail of the line, resumed the blockade of
Cadiz, where they arrived on the 2nd of April, and found there the
whole Spanish fleet of twenty-six sail of the line. Sir Horatio
Nelson, who at first commanded the advanced squadron, was ordered up
to Elba; and Sir James, in the Orion, succeeded in his room; during
which time the two Spanish frigates Nimfa and Elena were captured by
the Irresistible, Captain Martin, who chased them by signal from the
Orion. Sir James on this occasion sent a flag of truce, and entered
into correspondence with the Spanish admiral Mazarredo; which, we need
only add, completely succeeded, and met with the high approbation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> of
the commander-in-chief, as will appear from the following extracts of
letters from Earl St. Vincent to Saumarez.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Ville de Paris, 11th May 1797.</p>

<p>You approve yourself so able in the diplomatique, that you need no assistance
from me: in truth, a better despatch could not have been penn'd than yours of
yesterday to Don Joseph De Mazarredo.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">13th May.</p>

<p>I very much admire your last letter to Mazarredo, as I have done all the former.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">27th May.</p>

<p>I like your letter so much better than mine, of which I enclose a copy, that I
desire you will send it on immediately.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Ville de Paris, 30th May 1797.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any man to have acquitted himself with greater ability than
you have done during the time you commanded the blockade; for which I return you
my best thanks. Your last letter to Mazarredo is a masterpiece; and you will
perceive, by the enclosed copy of my letter to him, in answer to his comment on
our suspicion about the seamen from Trinidad, that I profited by your hint
relative to the prisoners landed at Lagos. Your lash on the destruction of the
Spanish ships he bears with Spanish stoicism: <span class="italic">nous verrons</span>.</p></div>

<p>The following communication from Sir James Saumarez to the
commander-in-chief will elucidate the foregoing extracts:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>(Secret.)</p>
<p class="right">Orion, 27th May, 1797.</p>

<p>Seeing the cutter on her way to the advanced squadron this morning, I waited to
send the flag of truce till she joined. I had prepared the enclosed for Don
Mazarredo, but was happy to find you had been pleased to take up the business. I
therefore confined my letter solely to the certificates for the seven men taken
in the two Spanish barks.&mdash;In a former letter, you were pleased to advert
to a proposed descent when the troops joined from Gibraltar. I hope you will
excuse the zeal that urges me to observe, that if possession was taken of Fort
St. Mary, it would in a great degree leave us masters of the entrance of Cadiz,
and enable us to drive all the outward ships up the harbour, and possibly
destroy some of them. I am extremely obliged to you for permitting the Flora to
remain with the advanced squadron, where she is of the greatest service.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="left65">I am with great respect, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right smcap">James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The high opinion entertained by Nelson of the great talent and zeal of
Saumarez, is evidenced in the following short, but characteristic
epistle:</p>

<p class="right">Theseus, June 9th 1797.</p>
<p>My <span class="smcap">dear Sir James</span>,</p>

<p>Send, I beg, whatever you think fit towards San Lucar: all you do is right, and
can hardly want my sanction. I hope your boats will be rewarded for their
trouble; they take all the prizes for our squadron.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The following letter to his brother in London gives an interesting
account of the proceedings of Sir James Saumarez.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, off Cadiz, 26th May, 1797.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Dear Richard,</p>

<p>I had the happiness to receive your kind letter of the 2nd yesterday,
with several of nearly the same date, from Bath, and from our friends
in the island. Having been near two months without hearing from you,
and knowing you had been ill, you will readily suppose I was anxious
for your letter. You will have heard from me by various opportunities
since we sailed from the Tagus; my last acquainting you that I was
entrusted with the command of the advanced squadron for effecting the
blockade of Cadiz. We find, from different accounts, that the
inhabitants feel great distress from the interruption of their trade,
and begin to be in great want of provisions and other articles. We
have detained a few neutrals laden with Spanish property, and two or
three Spanish vessels; but as the whole fleet partake of them, they
will not be very productive.</p>

<p>Sir Horatio, now Rear-admiral Nelson, joined the fleet yesterday,
having left the troops he brought from Elba at Gibraltar. I know not
whether he is to resume the command of the advanced squadron. All the
fleet are anchored about five miles from us, and we lie between them
and the entrance of Cadiz.</p>

<p>All private accounts from England agree with you in the prospect of
peace; and they are corroborated by those we occasionally receive from
Cadiz. It is certain that the Spaniards are extremely tired with the
war; and they are apprehensive of insurrection amongst themselves.
Mazarredo, who commands their fleet, went off for Madrid a fortnight
ago, and, it is said, to represent the state of the fleet, and its
insufficiency to cope with ours.</p>

<p>We understand Lord H. Seymour is off Cape St. Vincent, and that
Admiral Frederick is on his way with five <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>sail of the line. It looks
as if ministers meant to back the negociation with all their force.</p>

<p>The Admiralty order respecting the increase of wages, &amp;c. has been
read to the different ships' companies; and I am happy to observe that
in my ship no part of their conduct has hitherto shown the least
appearance of discontent. It is much to be lamented that the
disturbance which prevailed in the Channel fleet was not timely
prevented, as the same spirit of disaffection may hereafter show
itself when it may not be so easily suppressed.</p>

<p>We begin to want the luxuries, yet abound in the essentials of
life,&mdash;having plenty of beef, mutton, fowls, &amp;c. Seriously, I have not
had above twelve men in the sicklist since I left Lisbon, and most of
them slight complaints.</p>

<p>I want to hear that my sister has <span class="italic">dreamt</span> of another action,&mdash;or,
what is still better, of galleons! It must be soon, or the approaching
peace will oblige us to restore what we may capture. I am happy to
hear from my brother Thomas that things go on prosperously at
Guernsey, and that he does not fear the French, though the two
regiments are taken from him.</p>

<p class="left65">Adieu, my dear Richard!<br />
<span class="left10">Affectionately yours,</span></p>
<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>No part of the career of Sir James Saumarez is more deserving of
admiration than his conduct on the unfortunate disaffection which took
place in His Majesty's fleet; a calamity gently alluded to in the
above letter. This circumstance, which must ever redound to his
honour, was entirely owing to the high state of discipline of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
crew in his own ship, and to their unalterable attachment to their
commander, under whom the greatest part had served since the
commencement of the war. It was from a perfect knowledge of that
loyalty of spirit in which he justly confided, that he consented to
receive from the Prince George one of the worst of the mutineers in
that ship, who was to have been tried for his life. The seasonable
admonition which this man received from Sir James, and the attention
paid to his situation and feelings, had the desired effect of working
a complete change in his conduct, and from being one of the most
hardened of the mutineers, he soon became one of the most loyal, as he
was one of the bravest of English sailors. It was only three days
after he came on board that the signal was made for a boat from each
ship to attend the execution of three of the mutineers on board the
Prince George; which Earl St. Vincent, by a well-timed decision, had
ordered to take place very soon after the sentence, and while the
in-shore squadron were actually engaged with the enemy. He directed,
moreover, that this duty should be performed entirely by their own
ship's crew.</p>

<p>Sir James availed himself of this trying occasion to work out the
man's full conversion. Instead of sending him, as it is customary to
send culprits, in the boats to witness the execution of his shipmates,
he ordered him into his cabin, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> having represented in the mildest
and most feeling terms the heinousness of the crime which he was known
to have committed, he assured him that it was his intention to spare
him the anguish he must endure of beholding his late companions
suffering the last penalty of the law for the very crime of which he
had been guilty.</p>

<p>This well-timed exhortation had the desired effect. The penitent man
fell on his knees, and with tears in his eyes acknowledged the
heinousness of his offence, and expressed the strongest protestations
of future loyalty, and of gratitude as well as attachment to his
humane commander. What followed was most creditable to both. The man
not only kept his word, but highly distinguished himself: at the
battle of the Nile he was captain of a gun, and, after the action, was
very instrumental, from his exertions and ability as carpenter's mate,
in saving the Peuple Souverain, which struck to the Orion. Being one
of those who took possession of the former ship, he was slung over the
side, and successfully employed in stopping the shot-holes under water
as the vessel rolled in the opposite direction;&mdash;a dangerous service,
which requires much intrepidity and address.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, by no means surprising that the spirit of mutiny never
appeared in the Orion, or in any ship Sir James commanded. The proper
degree of discipline which was always maintained&mdash;the attention that
was invariably paid to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> wants and the comforts of the crew,&mdash;the
excellent regulations of his ship, which were subversive of every kind
of vice and immorality,&mdash;his own unaffected piety, and, lastly, the
example he himself set before his officers and men,&mdash;established in
his ship a feeling of respect for, and warm attachment to, the captain
which could not be shaken by any artifice of the wicked; for every
officer and man looked up habitually to their commander as their
<span class="italic">best</span> friend and adviser. There may, indeed, have been some ships,
wherein the crews were made up from the metropolitan and other
prisons, that no treatment would have brought under proper discipline;
but we may confidently assert, that had all the ships in His Majesty's
fleets been commanded by such officers as Saumarez, the disgraceful
spirit of insubordination would never have been so seriously and
generally diffused. The Orion's crew treated all attempts to seduce
them with just indignation!</p>

<p>Earl St. Vincent being well aware of the confidence that could be
placed in the Orion at this critical time, kept her, for the safety of
his fleet, constantly at the post of honour in the advance; and it was
during this period of active and arduous service that a circumstance
occurred which does honour to all concerned, while it particularly
displays the humane character of Captain Saumarez, who was not one of
those that desired or permitted his officers and men to risk their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
lives on any dangerous or desperate enterprise without a mature and
compassionate consideration of the consequences.</p>

<p>Near the fortifications of Cadiz, as if to guard the entrance of the
harbour, about twenty gun-vessels had been placed, which it appeared
to Earl St. Vincent might be cut out by the boats of the advanced
squadron; and accordingly an order was sent by the commander-in-chief
to Captain Saumarez, directing him to proceed in <span class="italic">person</span> with the
boats of each ship to make the attempt. It was sufficiently evident to
Captain Saumarez, who, from the position of the Orion, had a better
view of the gun-vessels, that they were moored there on purpose to
provoke an attack for which the enemy were well prepared; but, having
received the order to command in <span class="italic">person</span>, he could not make known his
opinions without appearing averse to risk his own life on an
enterprise which the commander-in-chief thought advisable. Having thus
in his own mind no doubt that the affair would be both desperate and
bloody, he selected those officers and men who were unmarried for the
service, a list of whom he sent to the first lieutenant, with the
necessary orders to prepare the boats.</p>

<p>This list being exhibited in the ward-room, Captain (now
Lieutenant-general Sir John) Savage, of the Marines, had the
mortification to see that his name was omitted, while those of the
two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> subalterns of that distinguished corps were inserted. This
gallant officer, who had been a sharer with his heroic chief in
several actions, felt hurt that he was not chosen on this glorious
occasion; and, having ventured respectfully to express his feelings,
was sent for to the cabin, when he was addressed by his commander in
the following terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>"Captain Savage, do not imagine that your name is left out in the list because I
have not a high opinion of your zeal and intrepidity. I well know that you would
be foremost in the assault; but I am also well aware that this is a desperate
enterprise: many will fall; and if <span class="italic">you</span> should be one, who is to support your
wife and family? The case is different with me: I am ordered, and my duty is to
obey. Perhaps if Lord St. Vincent knew what I do, he would not send us; but it
does not become me <span class="italic">now</span> to make any observation. However, aware as I am of the
consequences, I cannot conscientiously order you to accompany me, under the
conviction that your valuable life would thereby be sacrificed."</p></div>

<p>The entreaties of Captain Savage were in vain. He beheld with mixed
feelings of disappointment, gratitude, and admiration, his humane and
heroic commander leave his ship at the head of the perilous enterprise
with that smile on his manly countenance which denoted a full
determination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> to face every danger. The boats had not proceeded far
before a storm arose directly off the land, against which no boats
could make way, and it was with some difficulty they regained the
ships. It was afterwards fully ascertained from various sources that
these gun-vessels had been moored in that position with rivetted
chains, having no person on board them, in order to tempt an attack;
and that the plan was, to let the boats take possession, and then open
a destructive fire from the batteries, which were kept several nights
lined with troops for the purpose. Had not a merciful interposition of
Providence prevented the advance of the boats, there can be no doubt
that many, if not all the lives of the assailants, would have been
sacrificed!</p>

<p>We shall leave the feelings of Earl St. Vincent, when the truth came
out, as well as those of Captain Savage and all concerned, to the
imagination of the reader.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rear-admiral</span> Sir Horatio Nelson having resumed the command of the advanced
squadron, Earl St. Vincent determined to bombard the city of Cadiz, for the
double purpose of inducing the Spanish admiral Mazarredo, who had now
twenty-eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> sail of the line, to put to sea: the Earl wished moreover to
employ the minds of the seamen, which had become unsettled by the baneful
example of those in England. Accordingly the Thunder bomb, covered by the boats
of the squadron, made the first attempt; but her mortar was discovered to have
been injured in retreating: she was assailed by the Spaniards, when after a
desperate struggle she was rescued, and the Spanish commanding-officer, Don
Miguel Tyrason, was eventually made prisoner by Nelson, who also captured a
number of men and two mortar-boats.</p>

<p>On the 5th July, another bombardment took place by the Thunder,
Terror, and Strombolo, which being judiciously placed, their fire
produced a considerable effect on both the town and shipping, and
obliged the Spanish admirals to remove their fleet out of shell-range.
This attack, like the first, ended in an encounter between the
gun-boats. The third attempt, which was to have taken place on the
8th, was rendered abortive by a strong gale blowing off the shore.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Nelson having been detached with a squadron of three sail
of the line, a fifty, and three frigates, on the unfortunate
expedition to Teneriffe, the command of the advanced squadron again
devolved on Sir James Saumarez. Nothing could surpass the zeal and
intrepidity with which he performed this arduous duty. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> 18th
August he escorted a convoy to Gibraltar, and having refreshed his
crew and refitted his ship, he resumed his duty off Cadiz, sometimes
at anchor off the harbour, and under sail when obliged by the weather.
On the 15th November he was relieved, in order to refit at Lisbon, and
entered the Tagus on the 25th, returning about the same day in the
next month to the blockade of Cadiz, which was almost entirely
intrusted to him. Such indeed were his vigilance and activity, that
nothing escaped during that period. He displayed, moreover, great tact
and address in several communications with the Spanish admiral on the
subject of the exchange of prisoners, to the entire satisfaction of
Earl St. Vincent, the commander-in-chief, who had always reposed the
most implicit confidence in his judgment.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February 1798, the Spanish fleet were seen coming out of
Cadiz, and, in hopes of decoying them into the open sea, the English
fleet retired to Cape St. Vincent; but it was soon found that on the
14th the enemy had returned into port, being unwilling again to try
the fortune of war with such an opponent. The advanced squadron was at
that time commanded by Sir William Parker, who remained there.</p>

<p>Sir James Saumarez continued with the fleet until the 28th April, when
he was sent to refit at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>On the 8th May 1798, the Orion sailed from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> Gibraltar in company with
the Vanguard, Rear-admiral Sir Horatio Nelson,&mdash;the Alexander, Captain
Ball,&mdash;Emerald and Terpsichore frigates, and Bonne Citoyenne
sloop,&mdash;with orders from Earl St. Vincent to watch the enemy's fleet
at Toulon. When they were fairly through the Straits of Gibraltar, the
following order was given:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center"><span class="italic">Most secret rendezvous.</span></p>

<p>In the direct track between Cape Saint Sebastian's and Toulon, in lat. 42&deg; 20'
N. from twenty to thirty leagues from the Cape; and, not hearing where I may be,
in ten days return to Gibraltar.</p>

<p class="right">Given on board His Majesty's ship Vanguard,<br />
at sea, 14th May 1798.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To Sir J. Saumarez, Captain of H.M.S. Orion.<br />
<span class="i2">By command of the Rear-admiral,</span> <span class="i2 smcap">J. Campbell.</span></p></div>

<p>On the 17th, off Cape Sicie, the Orion being sent in chase, captured
the Pierre, French corvette, which sailed the evening before from
Toulon, and obtained the following information from the prisoners,
which was immediately sent to the Rear-admiral: viz. "That the enemy's
fleet, consisting of twelve sail of the line, besides six Venetian
ships, were in readiness to sail, with a great number of transports,
having on board both cavalry and infantry, on a secret expedition. The
French general Buonaparte arrived at Toulon ten days ago to command
the expedition, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> was to embark in the Sans-culotte, (afterwards
L'Orient,) which ship was said to have three thousand men on board,
including her complement; almost all the line-of-battle ships had
troops on board. Three frigates,&mdash;La Juno, La Diane, and La
Justice,&mdash;were seen by the corvette this morning, and sailed from
Toulon five days ago."</p>

<p>On the 19th a strong gale blew from the N.W. which being fair for the
enemy, they sailed from Toulon, and, calling off Genoa, stood across
to Cape Corse. This powerful expedition was found to consist of
thirteen sail of the line, six frigates, and transports amounting to
nearly four hundred sail, having on board, including the crews,
forty-eight thousand men. It appears that, although not many leagues
distant from Nelson's squadron, the fleet did not experience a gale
which blew with uncommon violence on the 21st, and in which, after
losing her three top-masts, the Vanguard lost her fore-mast and sprung
her bowsprit; while the Orion and Alexander lost each a main-top-sail,
and it was with difficulty they reached the Bay of St. Pietro in
Sardinia on the following day. Here the squadron had a narrow escape;
for, besides crossing the track of the enemy on the night of the 20th,
they, by being at anchor in this bay, were not discovered by a
detachment which the enemy sent in quest of them, and to which, in
their disabled state, they must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> been an easy capture. By the
assistance of the Orion and Alexander the damages of the Vanguard were
repaired in four days!</p>

<p>It has been justly said by Nelson, that "the exertions of Sir James
Saumarez in the Orion have been wonderful: if the Vanguard had been in
England, months would have been taken to send her to sea; here my
operations will not be delayed four days, and I shall rejoin the rest
of my fleet on the rendezvous." <a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>Accordingly, on the 27th, while
the Orion was taking possession of a Spanish brig, the Vanguard and
Alexander joined her off the port; but the frigates which had parted
never afterwards joined.</p>

<p>The following journal, written in the shape of a letter by Sir James
to his family, detailing the proceedings of the squadron, and the
events previous to the memorable 1st of August, will be read with much
interest.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">"Orion, St. Peter's Port, <br />
"Island of Sardinia, 24th May 1798.</p></div>

<p>"If the letter I sent you the 18th instant arrives safely, it will
apprise you of our being in the neighbourhood of Toulon, with every
prospect of a propitious cruise. The squadron experienced blowing
weather till the Sunday following, when it became more moderate; and
in the afternoon a valuable vessel was captured, from Smyrna, laden
with cotton. This little success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> appeared the forerunner of our
future good fortune; and we began to make exulting reflections on the
advantages of our situation. A few hours, however, convinced us of the
futility of all our views, and the instability of human projects: at
ten o'clock the wind began to increase with such rapidity as scarcely
to give us time to take in our sails, and prepare to encounter the
gale: at midnight we were reduced to a close-reefed main-topsail; a
tremendous sea, and vivid flashes of lightning, convinced us that the
storm was not at its height: at three o'clock our main-top-sail was
shattered to ribands, and blew overboard.</p>

<p>"The dawn of day presented to us a sad spectacle: the Vanguard without
a fore-mast, and her main and mizen-top-mast gone; the rest of the
squadron much dispersed, and the prize captured the evening before not
in sight.</p>

<p>"Providentially the Vanguard was enabled to <span class="italic">wear</span> on the other
<span class="italic">tack</span>, as the sea was setting her fast towards Corsica, from which
island we were not many leagues distant. The gale continued with
unabated violence until the afternoon, when it became rather more
moderate, but still there was a very great sea. This ship, with the
Alexander and Emerald, kept company with the Admiral, and the latter
parted in the night.</p>

<p>"The next morning the gale had considerably abated, and we were
enabled to set some sail. The Admiral hailed me that he intended to
proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> for Orestan Bay, in the island of Sardinia, and directed me
to make the land, which we discovered at noon: but the wind would not
enable the Vanguard, in her disabled state, to reach it before night;
and Sir H. Nelson altered his intention for this bay, which we reached
yesterday morning, though not without having passed a most anxious
night: the Alexander having the Vanguard in tow, within three miles of
a most dangerous coast, where there existed no possibility of
anchoring, and with which we were totally unacquainted. This is a very
safe harbour, sheltered from any wind, very happily for us; as the
weather has continued very unsettled since we are here. St. Pietro is
a very small town; and the island, as well as this part of Sardinia,
appears very uncultivated.</p>

<p>"The governor sent an officer to the Admiral this morning, who very
civilly informed us that by a late alliance with France he was not
permitted to admit us in the port; at the same time observing that, as
he could not prevent it, we might do as we pleased, but that he could
not give us <span class="italic">pratique</span>.</p>

<p>"We are going on in the equipment of the Vanguard with all expedition;
and we hope the three ships will be ready to sail by next Sunday, Sir
H. Nelson is happily very well, and has not lost his usual spirits.</p>

<p>"Friday, 25th.&mdash;Whilst I was on shore this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> morning to have some
conversation with the governor, a sail was discovered off the island,
and my signal made to prepare to proceed after her, supposing she was
an enemy. We are however disappointed, it being a neutral vessel from
Cagliari, the principal port in Sardinia; and I am now returning to
the anchorage. I have great hopes my having been on shore this morning
will be attended with a good effect; the governor having promised to
supply us with oxen, sheep, and as much poultry as can be procured by
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 27th May.&mdash;This morning my signal was made to chase a vessel,
which I came up with and captured: she proved a Spanish brig from
Cagliari, laden with wheat. It was in contemplation to set fire to
her; we, however, finally determined to send the people on shore, and,
if they bring off the value of the corn, we shall restore her to them.
The Vanguard, being repaired of her damages, got under way this
morning with the Alexander. I was happy to find my negotiation with
the governor succeeded; and we have been supplied with the articles I
mentioned, on moderate terms, both for the ships' companies and
officers, which is a seasonable relief, as Gibraltar supplied us with
nothing whatever excepting fowls.</p>

<p>"I am not free from great anxiety lest the account of the gale we
encountered may reach England before that of our safety shall arrive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and give you some uneasiness; but the experience you have had how
nugatory all such fears are, will, I hope, make you banish them for
ever.</p>

<p>"Monday, 29th.&mdash;The Spaniard not having come off as was expected, the
Admiral determined on sending the prize to Gibraltar. I hazarded a
line by her for Mr. Le Mesurier; but we form no great expectation of
her safety, from the great number of the enemy's gun-boats. A vessel
we spoke yesterday, from Marseilles, informs us that the French fleet
put to sea, the 20th, from Toulon, with all their transports, &amp;c.: as
it was that evening the gale of wind came on, we have no doubt but
they must have suffered severely. By this vessel we have also several
papers from Paris, the latest dated the 16th instant: they contain
extracts from the English papers, which to us are very interesting,
viz. the capture of the Hercule, the defeat at <ins title="Corrected erratum: original reads 'Marcon'">Marcou</ins>, Sir Sidney
Smith's escape, and other important news, which, on the whole, are
favourable to the welfare of the country, particularly as regards the
unanimity which appears to prevail in England.</p>

<p>"I dined, together with Captain Ball, on board the Vanguard: we all
form great expectations of our future success, which, I trust, will be
realized. Certain it is that no ships could be ordered on a more
promising service.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 3rd June&mdash;Nothing particular has occurred these last days.
Yesterday a vessel was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> spoken with, which mentioned having seen
eleven sail of the line, a few days ago, supposed to be English. We
are at a loss what conjectures to put on this intelligence. We are at
present off Toulon: unfortunately, none of our frigates have joined
us, and we are apprehensive they have returned to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>"Tuesday.&mdash;La Mutine brig joined us this morning, with the very
interesting intelligence of the arrival off Cadiz of the reinforcement
under Sir R. Curtis; and that Captain Troubridge, with eleven sail,
was on his way to join us: we look for him with the utmost impatience,
trusting in the Divine Providence to be in time to baffle the designs
of the enemy, who, we understand, are certainly gone to Naples with
their numerous army. I shall now go on with this journal with great
glee, inasmuch as our proceedings are becoming of such very great
import.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 7th.&mdash;Nothing can equal our anxiety to fall in with the
reinforcement. Our squadron has been, these two days, detached in all
directions, without falling in with them; and there is strong reason
to fear they think us returned to Gibraltar. This morning the
Alexander and myself chased two vessels, one of which we have just
taken possession of; she proves a Spanish vessel from Genoa, not very
valuable: the other the Alexander is still in chase of.</p>

<p>"Friday, 8th.&mdash;As this is in some degree to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> a faithful account of
our transactions, I must not conceal from you the deep distress I have
been under at finding myself this morning parted from the Vanguard,
and the Alexander almost out of sight; knowing how important and very
material it was, for the good of the service we were upon, that the
squadron should not be separated. It was not till this afternoon I was
relieved from the most acute anxiety I have ever suffered, by the
Leander joining me, with the very satisfactory account that Sir H.
Nelson, while we were in chase, fell in with the expected ships under
Captain Troubridge, and which occasioned our separation. I am now
under full sail to join them; and have not the least doubt of being in
time to add my endeavours to promote the tranquillity of Christendom
by the destruction of the enemy's fleet, which, I firmly believe,
cannot now escape us.</p>

<p>"Our prize requiring more men than I can at this time conveniently
spare to navigate her, I have consented to her being ransomed for ten
thousand dollars, although, I dare say, worth more than five times
that sum. She had thirty-six ex-Jesuits (Spanish priests), who, after
having been banished from Spain, had resided thirty-one years in
Italy, '<span class="italic">et &agrave; pr&eacute;sent pr&eacute;voyans le bannissement menac&eacute; des ex-Jesuites
Espagnols des nouvelles r&eacute;publiques Italiennes, retournoient chez
eux</span>.' Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> these poor wretches are driven about according to the
prejudices of the times. She had also on board Swiss recruits for the
Spanish army, eight of whom have entered volunteers in Captain
Savage's corps, which I consider an acquisition: but no captured
vessel ever gave so much uneasiness as she has caused me; and I have
often wished we had never seen her, even had she been worth a million
of money.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 10th June.&mdash;I had the great satisfaction yesterday to join
Sir H. Nelson with the reinforcement; and this morning the Alexander
joined us, after having captured the prize she chased, which I
understand to be a valuable ship, also from Genoa.</p>

<p>"We are now fourteen sail of the line, with La Mutine brig only; our
present anxiety is to gain information of the enemy's fleet, and to
find them where we can attack them. I hope to give you soon good
intelligence of them, and speedily be the bearer of the good news in
person, as Sir H. Nelson has orders to send the Orion home, when he
can spare her. What a blessing if our present endeavours should be
crowned with success, and I have the good fortune to proceed to
England immediately after; which at present is really intended, having
seen the order from the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, June 12th: off Elba.&mdash;We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> reached this distance without
having been enabled to obtain any information of the enemy, who we
have reason to think are not far from our squadron: the winds have
been very favourable to us, as at this time of the year calms are very
prevailing. Although a long period has elapsed since I was on this
station, I derive great advantage, as well as satisfaction, from my
recollection of the different places we have passed. We are at present
between Corsica and Leghorn, about fifteen leagues from the latter: if
we do not hear anything of the French fleet before we get to Naples,
we shall rendezvous at that place; and, we hope, in time to save that
country from the hands of our rapacious enemy.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 14th.&mdash;The Admiral has this morning made the signal of his
having gained intelligence of the enemy, and that they were off
Syracuse in the island of Sicily. This information has been
communicated by a Moor that the Leander has spoken with. We are now in
full sail, with a fresh breeze of wind; and to-morrow we hope to get
sight of Naples, in order to obtain more certain accounts of them. The
officers and crews in the several ships are all in the highest
spirits; and I never remember going into action with more certain
hopes of success.</p>

<p>"Friday, 15th.&mdash;I dined with Sir Horatio to-day, and find his
intelligence only extends to the enemy's fleet having been seen off
Sicily. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> he has sent Captain Troubridge in La Mutine to Naples, we
may expect to-morrow more certain accounts of them; but we have reason
to suppose them gone for Alexandria, the distance from which to the
Red Sea is only three days' journey. They may soon be transported
thence by water to the East Indies, with the assistance of their ally
and our inveterate enemy, Tippoo Saib; and with their numerous army
they expect to drive us out of our possessions in India. This profound
scheme, which is thought very feasible, we hope to frustrate by coming
up with them before they reach the place of their destination; and, as
we know them to have great numbers of troops embarked in their
men-of-war, they will become an easier prey to us.</p>

<p>"Saturday, 16th.&mdash;Calms and baffling winds since yesterday have
prevented our getting within sight of Naples, although all the time
within a few miles of that beautiful place; which you must suppose has
been mortifying to an extreme. We are looking out for the Mutine. As
soon as she joins us we expect to proceed in search of the enemy. Our
route lies through a passage often celebrated by the ancients, "the
famous Scylla and Charybdis." We shall have sight of Mount &AElig;tna and
other volcanoes, particularly Mount Strombolo, and other small islands
formed by subterranean eruptions. We are at present in sight of
Vesuvius, at the foot of which Naples is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> situated; but we are at too
great a distance to observe its fiery eruptions.</p>

<p>"Sunday, June 17th. The wind has favoured us this morning, and given
us a good sight of the Bay of Naples; but at too great a distance to
see much of the city. The country around it, as well as several of the
islands that form the bay, are beautifully interspersed with towns and
villages; the whole presenting a most delightful scene. At 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> La
Mutine joined us; and, from what I can understand from Sir H. Nelson,
brings him some information of the enemy's fleet. He has just hailed
me to say they were seen eight days ago, but I could not distinguish
at what place. We are again making all possible sail after them.</p>

<p>"I regret much not having been able to send a letter I had written to
you, and carried on board the Admiral this morning; <span class="italic">mais tu sais bien
qu'il ne se met gu&egrave;re en peine d'&eacute;crire lui-m&ecirc;me</span>, and he is so full
of mystery at this time that he seems unwilling any letter should be
sent but those he writes to Government. It shall go some other
opportunity.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, 19th.&mdash;This morning has presented to us a delightful view of
Mount Strombolo, from the top of which we plainly discern constant
columns of smoke; and, although at the distance of at least six
leagues from it, I can assure you, without assuming the privilege of
travellers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> general, that I am very sensible of the sulphureous
vapour produced by the volcano: at the same time, it may be necessary
to observe, that the wind blows directly towards the ship. Strombolo
is a remarkably high island, of a regular conical form, and may be
seen at the distance of twenty leagues. It is about ten miles in
circumference, and, I understand, is inhabited by a few fishermen.
Unluckily, the weather is too hazy to admit our seeing much of the
beautiful coast of Calabria, which is at no great distance from us.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 20th.&mdash;We have now a pleasant breeze, which will soon waft
us through the Straits of Messina, so famous for being the terror of
the ancients. An old pilot is just come on board, who reminds me more
of the poet's description of old Charon than of a modern human being.
I hope he is not come to ferry us across the Styx. The whole of his
crew have the same grotesque appearance. We can now discern the famous
&AElig;tna disgorging columns of smoke. Some distance below its summit it
appears covered with snow, whilst we are here melting with heat. It
has indeed a most stately appearance; and the whole country of Sicily
answers everything that has been reported of it for its fertility, as
well as for the varied beauty of its scene: but I must recommend you
to read Brydone's travels through Sicily and Malta, a writer who, I
recollect, gives a lively description of these different places.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have this day been regaled with a most enchanting prospect in
passing through the Faro of Messina. It is not more than three miles
distant, and on each side lies the most picturesque and lovely country
that can be described. The ship was within a mile of the beautiful
city of Messina, where I distinctly observed some of the ruins
occasioned by the earthquake in the year 1783.</p>

<p>"From what I have been able to learn from old Charon (who has just
left us in perfect safety), the French fleet are still off Malta; and
it appears their formidable armament is directed against that island.
As it is a place of great strength, and as we are within two days'
sail of it, with a favourable wind, I hope we shall be in time for its
relief, and add still more important exploits to many that have
formerly been achieved in fighting for its defence.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 21st.&mdash;The wind has proved rather contrary for the squadron
since yesterday. We are still in sight of Mount &AElig;tna, and only a few
leagues from the nearest part of Sicily: the ancient city of Syracuse
is discernible from the ship. To-morrow I think will bring us in view
of the enemy's fleet, which will be a far more desirable sight.</p>

<p>"June 22nd.&mdash;I am just returned from on board the Admiral, where I had
the mortification to learn that a vessel, which sailed yesterday from
Malta, gives the very unpleasing account that the island<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> had
surrendered to the French, and that their fleet left it six days ago.
This intelligence has more than ever left us in perplexity as to their
further destination. On the supposition that Alexandria, as we first
conjectured, was what they had in view, we are crowding sail for that
place; but the contrast to what we experienced yesterday is great
indeed, having made sure of attacking them this morning. At present it
is very doubtful whether we shall fall in with them at all, as we are
proceeding upon the merest conjecture only, and not on any positive
information. Some days must now elapse before we can be relieved from
our cruel suspense; and if, at the end of our journey, we find we are
upon a wrong scent, our embarrassment will be great indeed.
Fortunately, I only act here <span class="italic">en second</span>; but did the chief
responsibility rest with me, I fear it would be more than my too
irritable nerves would bear. They have already been put to the trial
in two or three instances this voyage.</p>

<p>"I should observe that we saw three French frigates this morning, but
they were not considered of sufficient importance to run the risk of
separating the squadron in chasing them. The island of Malta will
prove a great acquisition to the French; as well for its excellent
harbour as for the immense wealth it contains: they will also get a
few ships of war and a considerable quantity of naval stores.
<span class="italic">D'ailleurs</span>, the suppression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> of a useless order that encouraged
idleness will be no real detriment to the cause of Christianity.</p>

<p>"Sunday, June 24th.&mdash;The last two days we have not gone less than a
hundred leagues; and, as the wind continues favourable, we hope to
arrive at Alexandria before the French, should their destination be
for that place, which continues very doubtful. At the same time, if it
should prove that our possessions in India is the object of their
armament, our having followed them so immediately appears the only
means of saving that country from falling into their hands. I
therefore hope that credit will be given us for our intentions at
least. We have hitherto been certainly unfortunate, which has chiefly
arisen from the reinforcement not joining sooner; the French armament
sailed from Toulon five days before Captain Troubridge left Lord St.
Vincent: another circumstance has been the separation of all our
frigates, which deprived us of the means of obtaining information. The
day we were off Naples the French fleet left Malta, and it was not
until we arrived off that island, six days after, that we heard of its
being taken, and that the French fleet had left it; and then without
the least intimation which way they were going.</p>

<p>"Sir H. Nelson consulted with some of the senior captains, who agreed
with his opinion, that, in the uncertainty where the enemy were gone,
the preservation of our possessions should be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> first
consideration. It may be worth remarking that our squadron was sent,
on the application of the King of Naples, for the protection of his
dominions. On our arrival there, and requiring the co-operation of his
ships, the reply was, that, as the French had not declared war against
him, he could not commence hostilities; that if the Emperor declared
war, he would also join against France. Should his territories be
attacked, he has to thank himself for the event.</p>

<p>"We must hope that in England affairs prosper better than in this
country; they are certainly <span class="italic">en fort mauvais train</span> in this part of
the world.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, 26th.&mdash;We are now within one day's sail of Alexandria, so
that we hope soon to know whether the French fleet are in this
direction; but having seen no appearance of any of their numerous
convoy, we begin to fear they are gone some other way. I was this
morning on board the Admiral; he has detached La Mutine for
information. I hope she will not find the plague there, to which that
country is very subject.</p>

<p>"Friday, 29th.&mdash;The weather did not permit us to get near Alexandria
before yesterday. La Mutine's boat went on shore; and I find this
morning from the Admiral that they took us for the French fleet,
having had some intimation of their coming this way. We have now to
use all despatch in getting back towards Naples; it is probable we
shall learn something of them on our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> passage. The squadron has
captured a French ship this afternoon, which we suppose to be from
Alexandria. I have passed the day on board the Vanguard, having
breakfasted and staid to dinner with the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 1st July.&mdash;The wind continues to the westward, and I am sorry
to find it is almost as prevailing as the trade-winds. The vessel
captured the day before yesterday was set on fire, after taking out
what could be useful for firewood.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 29th July: off Candia.&mdash;A small vessel, captured yesterday by
the Culloden, gave some information of the enemy's fleet. The Admiral
having made the signal that he had gained intelligence of them, we are
proceeding with a brisk gale for Alexandria. If at the end of our
voyage we find the enemy in a situation where we can attack them, we
shall think ourselves amply repaid for our various disappointments.
The Alexander also spoke a vessel which gave information; but, having
had no communication with the Admiral, we have not been able to learn
the different accounts: we are however satisfied with the purport of
the signal he made yesterday.</p>

<p>"Monday.&mdash;I find from Captain Ball that the enemy were seen steering
towards Alexandria <span class="italic">thirty</span> days ago, and we are once more making the
best of our way for that place. I also understand that two of our
frigates were seen a few days since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> at Candia; it seems decreed we
shall never meet with them. I am rather surprised the Admiral did not
endeavour to fall in with them, as they probably have certain
information where the enemy's fleet are, from vessels they may have
spoken with, and they otherwise would be a great acquisition to our
squadron."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>It may now be stated, that in the mean time the French expedition had
landed the troops and taken possession, not only of Alexandria, but
Cairo; and that their fleet, consisting of thirteen sail of the line,
four frigates, two brigs, and several bombs and armed vessels, had
taken up a position in the Bay of Aboukir, in which, according to the
opinion of their admiral, they could "defy the British navy."</p>

<p>As a particular list of both fleets will be given in a subsequent
place, I need now only mention that the force of the British fleet was
fourteen ships of seventy-four guns, one of fifty, and the Mutine
brig. The fleet was manned with 7,000 men; but as the Culloden, which
was not in the action, must not be included, the actual force may be
estimated 6,300 men and 872 guns, while the enemy's force, actually
opposed, may be reckoned 8,000 men, and 1,208 guns throwing a
broadside of one-half more weight than the British.</p>

<p>On the junction of the squadron, the following orders were given by
the Admiral:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">General Order.</p>
<p class="right">Vanguard, at sea, 8th June 1798.</p>

<p>As it is very probable the enemy may not be formed in regular order on the
approach of the squadron under my command, I may in that case deem it most
expedient to attack them by separate divisions; in which case, the commanders of
divisions are strictly enjoined to keep their ships in the closest order
possible, and on no account whatever to risk the separation of one of their
ships. The captains of the ships will see the necessity of strictly attending to
close order: and, should they compel any of the enemy's ships to strike their
colours, they are at liberty to judge and act accordingly, whether or not it may
be most advisable to cut away their masts and bowsprits; with this special
observance, namely, that the destruction of the enemy's armament is the sole
object. The ships of the enemy are, therefore, to be taken possession of by an
officer and one boat's crew only, in order that the British ships may be enabled
to continue the attack, and preserve their stations.</p>

<p>The commanders of divisions are to observe that no consideration is to induce
them to separate in pursuing the enemy, unless by signal from me, so as to be
unable to form a speedy junction with me; and the ships are to be kept in that
order that the whole squadron may act as a single ship. When I make the signal
No. 16, the commanders of divisions are to lead their separate squadrons, and
they are to accompany the signal they may think proper to make with the
appropriate triangular flag, viz. Sir James Saumarez will hoist the triangular
flag, white with a red stripe, significant of the van squadron under the
commander in the second post; Captain Troubridge will hoist the triangular blue
flag, significant of the rear squadron under the commander in the third post;
and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>whenever I mean to address the centre squadron only, I shall accompany the
signal with the triangular red flag, significant of the centre squadron under
the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class="right">Vanguard, at sea, 8th June 1798.</p>

<p>As the wind may probably blow along shore when it is deemed necessary to anchor
and engage the enemy at their anchorage, it is recommended to each
line-of-battle ship of the squadron to prepare to anchor with the sheet-cable in
abaft and springs, &amp;c.&mdash;Vide Signal 54, and Instructions thereon, page
56, &amp;c. Article 37 of the Instructions.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To the respective Captains, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mem. P.S.&mdash;To be inserted in pencil in the Signal-Book, at No. 182. Being
to windward of the enemy, to denote that I mean to attack the enemy's line from
the rear towards the van, as far as thirteen ships, or whatever number of the
British ships of the line may be present, that each ship may know his opponent
in the enemy's line.</p>

<p>No. 183. I mean to press hard with the whole force on the enemy's rear.</p></div>

<p>The proceedings of Sir Horatio Nelson's squadron are now brought down
to the moment when their united, ardent, and anxious wishes were to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
be realized. The disappointments they had met with during their
hitherto fruitless pursuit,&mdash;the state of anxiety, of alternate hope
and despair, in which they had been kept, had raised their feelings of
emulation to a pitch far beyond description; this was soon to be
manifested by the endeavours of each to close with the enemy.</p>

<p>Never could there have been selected a set of officers better
calculated for such a service; Nelson was fortunate in commanding
them, and they in being commanded by him. It is true, indeed, that his
particular favourite, Captain Troubridge, was intended for his
second-in-command, instead of Sir James Saumarez; and the latter would
no doubt have been sent home, according to the orders he had received:
but, with the chance of such an engagement as that which they
anticipated, the well-tried captain of the Orion and his highly
disciplined crew could not be spared; and, although Nelson carefully
concealed his feelings towards Saumarez, they were but too manifest by
the chary manner in which he expressed himself on this and on former
occasions.</p>

<p>In consequence of the before-mentioned information, the fleet bore up
for Alexandria; and on the morning of the 1st of August the towers of
that celebrated city, and Pompey's Pillar made their appearance. Soon
after was discerned a forest of masts in the harbour, which they had
previously seen empty; and, lastly, the French flag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> waving over its
walls. A general disappointment was caused for a short time by a
signal from the look-out ships that the enemy's men-of-war did not
form a part of the vessels at anchor there; but this was soon
dispelled by a signal from the Zealous that the enemy's fleet occupied
the Bay of Aboukir in a line of battle, thirteen ships, four frigates,
and two brigs, in sight on the larboard bow. At half-past two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the
British fleet hauled up, and steered directly for them with a fine
N.N.W. breeze, carrying top-gallant sails.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>When the Admiral made the signal to prepare for battle, at half-past
three, the signal to haul the wind on the starboard tack, and for the
<ins title="Corrected erratum: original reads 'Colossus'">Culloden</ins> to cast off her prize, the Swiftsure and Alexander, which had
been recalled from looking out off Alexandria, were carrying all sail
to join. At five,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> the Admiral made the signal that it was his
intention to attack the van and centre of the enemy as they lay at
anchor, which was repeated by the Orion. At forty-five minutes past
five, he made the signal to form the line as most convenient. The
fleet then formed in the following order:&mdash;Goliath, Zealous, Vanguard,
Minotaur, Theseus, Bellerophon, Defence, Orion, Audacious, Majestic,
and Leander. The Culloden was then astern the Swiftsure, and the
Alexander to leeward, tacking to clear the reef. The Admiral hove to,
to pick up a boat, and also the four next ships astern of the
Vanguard, which gave the Orion an opportunity, by standing on and
passing them, to get up with the Zealous at about half-past six.</p>

<p>In ten minutes afterwards the signal for close action was made, and
repeated by most of the fleet; at the same time, the Goliath, having
passed round the enemy's headmost ship, anchored on the quarter of the
second; while the Zealous took her position on the bow of the former
ship; both anchoring by the stern. The batteries on the island of
Bequir or Aboukir, and the headmost ships, opened their fire as the
leading ship approached; and they in return opened theirs on rounding
the advanced ship of the enemy's line.</p>

<p>The Orion, after giving that ship her broadside, passed round the
Zealous and Goliath; and, as she was passing the third ship of the
enemy, the French frigate S&eacute;rieuse approached, began to fire<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> on her,
and wounded two men. In reply to an observation of one of the
officers, who proposed to return her fire immediately, Sir James said,
"Let her alone, she will get courage and come nearer. Shorten sail."
As the Orion lost way by shortening sail, the frigate came up; and,
when judged to be sufficiently advanced, orders were given to yaw the
Orion, and stand by the starboard guns, which were double-shotted. The
moment having arrived when every gun was brought to bear, the fatal
order to fire was given; when, by this single but well-directed
broadside, the unfortunate S&eacute;rieuse was not only totally dismasted,
but shortly afterwards sunk, and was discovered next morning with only
her quarter above water.</p>

<p>On discharging this fatal broadside the helm was put hard a-starboard;
but it was found that the ship would not fetch sufficiently to
windward, and near to the Goliath, if she anchored by the stern. She
stood on, and, having given the fourth ship her starboard broadside,
let go her bower anchor, and brought up on the quarter of Le Peuple
Souverain, which was the fifth ship, and on the bow of Le Franklin,
the sixth ship of the enemy's line. The third and fourth ships were
occupied by the Theseus and Audacious on the inside, by passing
through; while they were attacked on the outside by the Minotaur,
Vanguard, and Defence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>By the log of the Orion it was forty-five minutes past six o'clock
when that ship let go her anchor, and, in "tending," poured her
starboard broadside into the Franklin and L'Orient. The fire was then
directed on Le Peuple Souverain, until she cut and dropped out of the
line, totally dismasted and silenced.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the headmost ships were dismasted; a fire-raft was
observed dropping down from them on the Orion. Her stern-boat having
been shot through, and the others being on the booms, it was
impossible to have recourse to the usual method of towing it clear:
booms were then prepared to keep it off. As it approached, however,
the current carried it about twenty-five yards clear of the ship.
About half-past eight, just as the Peuple Souverain, which had been
the Orion's opponent, had dropped to leeward, a suspicious ship was
seen approaching the Orion in the vacant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> space which the vanquished
one had occupied. Many on board were convinced of her being a
fire-ship of the enemy, and Sir James was urged to allow the guns to
be turned upon her. Happily he himself had stronger doubts of her
being such than those who pressed the reverse. He ordered a vigilant
watch to be kept on her movements; and when the darkness dispersed,
she was discovered to be the Leander. Distinguishing lights were
hoisted, and the Orion continued to engage Le Franklin from fifty
minutes past six o'clock to a quarter before ten. The action was
general, and kept up on both sides with perseverance and vigour, when
the enemy's fire began to slacken, and the three-decker was discovered
to be on fire. At ten the firing ceased; the ship opposed to the Orion
having surrendered, as also all the van of the enemy.</p>

<p>Preparations were now made to secure the ships from the effects of the
expected explosion.&mdash;The ports were lowered down, the magazine
secured, the sails handed, and water placed in various parts to
extinguish whatever flames might be communicated. The unfortunate ship
was now in a blaze; at half-past eleven she blew up, and the
tremendous concussion was felt at the very kelsons of all the ships
near her. The combatants on both sides seemed equally to feel the
solemnity of this destructive scene. A pause of at least ten minutes
ensued, each engaged in contemplating a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> sight so grand and terrible.
The Orion was not far off; but, being happily placed to windward, the
few fiery fragments that fell in her were soon extinguished. Her
vicinity to the L'Orient was the happy means of saving the lives of
fourteen of her crew, who, in trying to escape the flames, sought
refuge in another element, and swam to the Orion, where they met a
reception worthy the humanity of the conquerors. The generous,
warm-hearted sailors stripped off their jackets to cover these
unfortunate men, and treated them with kindness, proving that humanity
is compatible with bravery.</p>

<p>About the middle of the action Sir James received a wound from a
splinter, or rather the sheave from the heel of the spare top-mast on
the booms, which, after killing Mr. Baird, the clerk, and wounding Mr.
Miells, a midshipman, mortally, struck him on the thigh and side, when
he fell into the arms of Captain Savage, who conducted him under the
half-deck, where he soon recovered from the shock it gave him: but
although he acknowledged it was painful, and might in the end be
serious, he could not be persuaded to leave the deck even to have the
wound examined; and the part was so much swelled and inflamed on the
next day, that he was not able to leave the ship.</p>

<p>After the pause occasioned by the dreadful explosion, the action
continued in the rear by the ships dropping down which were not too
much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> disabled; and Sir James had given orders to slip and run down to
the rear, when the master declared that the fore-mast and mizen-mast
were so badly wounded, that the moment the ship came broadside to the
wind, they would go over the side, particularly the fore-mast, which
was cut more than half through in three places. It was therefore
determined to secure the disabled masts and repair other damages,
while the action was renewed by those that were not so much disabled.</p>

<p>As soon as the battle ceased in the van, by the capture of the enemy's
ships, Sir James, who was the senior captain of the fleet, ordered
Lieutenant Barker on board the Admiral for the purpose of inquiring
after his safety, and of receiving his further instructions. He
shortly returned with the melancholy detail that Sir Horatio was
severely wounded in the head. At this period, several of the ships of
the squadron were still warmly engaged with the centre and part of the
rear of the enemy's fleet. Sir James therefore sent a boat to such
ships as appeared to be in condition, with directions to slip their
cables and assist their gallant companions. These orders were
immediately put in execution by that distinguished officer Captain
Miller, of the Theseus, and by the other ships that were in a state to
renew the action. It has been already stated that the masts of the
Orion were too much damaged to admit of that ship getting under way.
In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> course of the day the whole of the enemy's fleet had
surrendered, excepting two ships of the line and two frigates, which
escaped from the rear.</p>

<p>Sir James being unable, from the effects of his wound, to wait on the
Admiral and offer his congratulations personally, sent him the
following letter:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, 2nd August 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>
<p>I regret exceedingly being prevented from congratulating you in person on the
most complete and glorious victory ever yet obtained,&mdash;the just recompense
of the zeal and great anxiety so long experienced by you before it pleased
Providence to give you sight of those miscreants who have now received the just
punishment of their past crimes. You have been made the happy instrument of
inflicting on them their just chastisement; and may you, my dear Admiral, long
live to enjoy, in the approbation of the whole world, the greatest of earthly
blessings!</p>

<p class="left50">I am ever your most faithful and obedient servant,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Sir Horatio Nelson, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>From the character which has already been portrayed of Sir James, the
reader will not be surprised to find that the Orion was the first to
hoist the pendant at the mizen-peak, and thereby to show an example to
the fleet worthy of imitation, in returning thanks to the great
Disposer of events and Giver of all victory for that which they had
just obtained over their enemies. A discourse on this occasion was
delivered by the clergyman of the Orion, which must have made a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and lasting impression on the hearers; but the circumstance, which is
much easier to be imagined than described, of a ship's company on
their knees at prayers, and offering up a most solemn thanksgiving for
the Divine mercy and favour which had been so fully manifested towards
them, must have excited feelings in the minds of the prisoners,&mdash;the
demoralised citizens of the French republic,&mdash;which had never before
been known to them; and we understand that they did not fail to
express their astonishment and admiration at a scene of that kind
under such circumstances.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, when the action had entirely ceased, and the Admiral
had received the congratulations of most of the captains of the fleet,
the following general memorandums were issued:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Vanguard, 2nd of August 1798, off the mouth of the Nile.</p>

<p>The Admiral most heartily congratulates the captains, officers, seamen, and
marines of the squadron he has the honour to command, on the events of the late
action; and he desires they will accept his sincere and cordial thanks for their
very gallant behaviour in the glorious battle. It must strike forcibly every
British seaman how superior their conduct is when in discipline and good order,
to the notorious behaviour of lawless Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The squadron may be assured that the Admiral will not fail, in his despatches,
to represent their truly meritorious conduct in the strongest terms to the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To the respective Captains of the ships of the squadron.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Almighty God having blessed his Majesty's arms with victory, the
Admiral intends returning thanksgiving for the same at two o'clock
this day; and he recommends every ship doing the same as soon as
convenient.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To the respective Captains, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Captain Ball, in pursuance of orders from the Rear-admiral, directed
the negociation for landing the prisoners on parole. Such as were not
Frenchmen were permitted to enter into the English service, for the
purpose of conducting the prizes home.</p>

<p>We must refer our readers to the different accounts of this splendid
action, which have been published by James, Brenton, Willyams, &amp;c. for
the particulars which do not concern the Orion. But we cannot forbear
to mention the gallant conduct of Vice-admiral De Brueys, who,
according to James and others, "had received two wounds, one in the
face, the other in the hand; towards eight <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> as he was descending
to the quarter-deck, a shot cut him almost in two. This brave officer
then desired not to be carried below, but to be left to die on deck;
exclaiming in a firm tone, 'Un amiral Fran&ccedil;ais doit mourir sur son
banc de quart.' He survived only a quarter of an hour." Commodore
Casa-Bianca fell mortally wounded soon after the admiral had breathed
his last. Captain Du-Petit-Thouars, of the Tonnant, had first both his
arms, and then one of his legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> shot away; and his dying commands were
"Never to surrender!"</p>

<p>Neither must we leave unrecorded the heroic death of young Miells, the
midshipman, who we mentioned had been mortally wounded by the same
splinter which struck his gallant commander. His shoulder having been
nearly carried off, and his life being despaired of, the surgeons were
unwilling to put him to needless pain by amputation; but after some
hours, finding he still lived, it was determined to give him a chance
of recovery by removing the shattered limb. The operation was ably
performed by Mr. Nepecker, the surgeon of the Orion, assisted by the
surgeon of the Vanguard. The sufferer never uttered a moan, but as
soon as it was over, quietly said&mdash;"Have I not borne it well?" The
tidings were instantly conveyed to his captain, whose feelings may be
better imagined than described, and who could only fervently exclaim
"thank God!" But his joy soon received a check. Many minutes had not
elapsed before he learnt that this amiable and promising youth had
been seized with a fit of coughing and expired!</p>

<p>The captains of the Mercure and Heureux, who participated but slightly
in the action, were both wounded; Captain Trullet, of the Guerrier,
the ship most shattered, was unhurt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> and Gantheaume escaped in a boat
from the L'Orient.</p>

<p>By great care Sir James kept off the fever which threatened to be the
consequence of his wound.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd, Sir James, finding himself sufficiently
recovered from the effects of his wounds to leave the ship, went on
board the Vanguard to congratulate the Admiral in person on the
glorious result of the battle. He found several of his brother
officers on the quarter deck, discussing the merits of the action.
Some regret having been expressed at the escape of the two sternmost
ships of the French line, Sir James said to the Admiral, "It was
unfortunate we did not&mdash;&mdash;" and was proceeding to say, "all anchor on
the same side." But, before he could finish the sentence, Nelson
hastily interrupted him, exclaiming, "Thank God there was no order!"
thus turning the conversation, he entered his cabin, and sent for
Captain Ball.</p>

<p>While Sir James was receiving the congratulations of his brother
captains on being the second in command, no doubt being entertained
among them that the Admiral would make most honourable mention of his
name as such,&mdash;<span class="italic">an honour which he so highly deserved</span>, and which is
usual in similar cases,&mdash;Captain Ball came on deck, and interrupted
the conversation by observing, "Nelson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> says there is to be no second
in command; <span class="italic">we are all to be alike in his despatches</span>!"<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>We need scarcely say that this was eventually the case; but we may
relate the circumstances which induced Saumarez, without the least
intention to offend, to make the observation at which offence was
taken. It was the custom of Nelson, when in communication or in
company with the captains under his command, to converse with them on
the various modes of attacking the enemy under different
circumstances; and, on one of these occasions, Sir James Saumarez, who
had seen the evil consequences of <span class="italic">doubling</span> on the enemy, especially
in a night action, had differed with the Admiral in that plan of
attack, saying that "it never required two English ships to <span class="italic">capture</span>
one French, and that the damage which they must necessarily do to each
other might render<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> them both unable to fight an enemy's ship that had
not been engaged; and as in this case two ships could be spared to the
three-decker, every one might have his own opponent."</p>

<p>It would perhaps be deemed invidious to mention the individual cases
of English ships which fired on each other in this action; but that
this did actually happen, and that many of our brave men fell by our
own shot is a fact too notorious to be disputed. Moreover, had the
four sternmost ships of the enemy's line done their duty as they
ought, by slipping their cables soon after the action commenced, and
making sail to windward, they would have made an easy capture of the
Culloden as she lay aground; and afterwards, by doubling on the
Vanguard, they would probably have given a different turn to the
affair. The enemy's ships being moored 160 yards apart, left space
enough for the British ships to pass between them, and rake the ship
on each side, as the Theseus did; whereas, by anchoring outside, our
squadron had equally to suffer the raking fire of the enemy as they
approached, without being able to retaliate in the same way, thereby
losing the important effect of two double-shotted broadsides, besides
the advantage of being anchored in shore, to prevent the possibility
of the enemy <span class="italic">doubling</span> on a disabled ship, or of their running on
shore and destroying those that were vanquished.</p>

<p>It has been insisted on that Nelson, in omitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> to mention the name
of his second in command, only followed the example of Earl St.
Vincent; and this may have been the case; but it cannot justify his
evident reluctance to acknowledge the position in which Sir James
really stood. Every officer in the service must know that, if Nelson
had lost his life, the command would have devolved on Sir James
Saumarez: yet, in his public letter, he not only avoids mentioning
him, but he endeavours to represent the captain of the Vanguard as his
successor in that responsible situation. His great friendship for Sir
Thomas Troubridge was, no doubt, the motive that occasioned the
substitution, and led to this injustice, which he carried so far as to
remonstrate, in his private letters to Earl St. Vincent and Earl
Spencer, against any honours being conferred on Sir James Saumarez
which were not equally bestowed on Sir Thomas Troubridge. <a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>When
Nelson's great popularity, at this period, is considered, it may
appear less extraordinary that this request should have had weight.
Yet it cannot but surprise an impartial reader, in after-ages, that no
honours or distinctions, except on the commander-in-chief, should have
followed a victory, which Mr. Pitt in the House of Commons pronounced
to be the greatest on record.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of August, when Sir James returned from the Vanguard, the
captains were assembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> on board the Orion. He proposed the following
resolution, which was agreed to unanimously:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>The captains of the squadron under the orders of Rear-admiral Sir Horatio
Nelson, K.B. desirous of testifying the high sense they entertain of his prompt
decision and intrepid conduct in the attack of the French fleet in Bequir Road,
off the Nile, August 1st, 1798, request his acceptance of a sword; and, as a
further proof of their esteem and regard, hope that he will permit his portrait
to be taken, and hung up in the room belonging to the Egyptian club now
established, in commemoration of that glorious day.</p></div>

<p>To which Sir Horatio returned the following answer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I feel most sensibly the very distinguished honour you have conferred upon me by
your address this day. My prompt decision was the natural consequence of having
such captains under my command; and I thank God I can say that in the battle the
conduct of every officer was equal.</p>

<p>I accept as a particular mark of your esteem the sword you have done me the
honour to offer; and I will direct my picture to be painted the first
opportunity for the purpose you mention.</p>

<p class="left60">I have the honour to be, gentlemen,<br />
<span class="left5">with the highest respect,</span><br />
<span class="left10">Your most obliged,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p></div>

<p>We shall conclude this chapter with the extract of a letter written to
Lady Saumarez by Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> James, which we have no doubt will be perused
with much interest:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Thursday, 2nd August 1798.</p>

<p>Happy am I in being enabled, through the mercy of Divine Providence, to acquaint
you with our having obtained the most glorious and complete victory ever yet
recorded in the annals of the world.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon we discovered the enemy's fleet at anchor a short distance
from Alexandria. Although our squadron was not collected,&mdash;the Alexander
and Swiftsure being at a considerable distance from having been detached to
reconnoitre the port, and the Culloden a great way off from having had a prize
in tow,&mdash;Sir Horatio deemed it of such importance to make an immediate
attack on the enemy, that he made sail for them without waiting for those ships.</p>

<p>At sunset the action began upon the van and centre of the enemy's line, and in
rather more than two hours six of their ships were completely dismasted, and the
L'Orient, of 120 guns, blown up. The action was continued all night with the
enemy's rear by the Alexander and Majestic; and this evening the whole, except
three, have fallen into our hands, and a frigate, which they dastardly set fire
to, and escaped on shore.</p>

<p>The loss sustained has been considerable in some of the ships. I have to regret
the loss of poor Miells, and of Mr. Baird, my clerk, and of several good men. I
received a contusion in the side, which, though at first painful, is doing as
well as possible, and does not even prevent my going on with the usual duty of
the ship. Poor Captain Westcott is killed, and several other officers.</p>

<p>The enemy have now obtained the just chastisement of their past crimes, and Sir
Horatio Nelson has the happiness <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>of being the fortunate instrument of
inflicting their just punishment; in which happiness all his squadron partakes.
Fourteen of the Frenchmen, who had the good fortune to swim on board the Orion
from the L'Orient after she was on fire, report that their army were all landed
three weeks since, and are at present in possession of Grand Cairo; and that
they have frequent severe skirmishes with the Turks.</p>

<p>Our worthy friend Mr. Le Cras will lament with me the loss of Mr. Miells. A
better young man I think never existed. He lived until this evening, and was the
whole time perfectly resigned to his fate, saying, "he died in a good cause."
Mr. Richardson is also badly wounded, and my servant John Lewis, who you
recollect waited on us at Portsmouth; but I hope they will both recover.</p>

<p>I should observe that the Culloden, not having been able to get to us before
night, unfortunately ran aground; by which accident we were deprived of the
assistance of so fine a ship, and of the exertions of Captain Troubridge.</p></div>

the Leander, having on board Captain Berry with the Rear-admiral's
despatches, sailed for England; and, on the 12th, the Emerald,
Alcmene, and Bonne Citoyenne arrived. On the same day Sir James

from the officer under whose command you are for the time being; and you are
hereby required and directed to put yourself and the prize under the command of
Captain Sir James Saumarez; and follow all such orders <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>and instructions as you
may receive from him from time to time for his Majesty' service.</p>

<p class="right">Given on board H.M.S. Vanguard,<br />
Mouth of the Nile, 12th August 1798.</p></div>

<p>Thus were Sir James's wishes and anticipations, mentioned in his
journal of the 10th June, completely realized. After a distinguished
share in effecting the destruction of the enemy's fleet, he is
returning home triumphant with the hard-earned fruits of his labours;
which were, however, not yet at an end, as will be seen by the
following journal of his tedious and hazardous voyage:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">"Orion, at sea, 18th August 1798.</p></div>

<p>"After having so well completed the journal I sent by Captain Berry, you will
not doubt the great pleasure I must feel in beginning the present, particularly
when situation and many other circumstances combine to render it so interesting.
But I have more to relate than you are aware of; and in which I have been most
particularly favoured, as you will see, when it comes in its proper place to be
mentioned.</p>

<p>First, I sailed from Bequir Road last Tuesday morning, with seven sail of the
line and six of our prizes; leaving the Admiral with the Culloden, Alexander,
Zealous, Goliath, and Swiftsure, and the three remaining French ships, which it
was intended to destroy after taking out their stores and landing the prisoners.
The Alcmene, Emerald, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>and Bonne Citoyenne had at last joined us. As, however,
they had not been with the fleet, but had remained all the time in search of us,
we were disappointed of our letters, and <span class="italic">they</span> at finding themselves 'the day
after the fair.'</p>

<p>In falling light winds, we came again to an anchor, Tuesday noon, about five
miles from the squadron; which gave the ships an opportunity to get completed
for sea, and afforded a night's repose to the men. At eleven I was waked from a
sound sleep with the account that a brig which joined the Admiral in the
afternoon was from Tunis, and had on board a hundred men belonging to L'Aigle,
which had been lost some time before on her way to join the squadron; and it was
added, 'there is a large packet of letters for the different ships.' I soon had
them sorted, and out of about twenty for myself I selected four from you, which
were read with an avidity you will better conceive than I can describe; before I
had finished a page of one I flew to another, and so for near an hour, till at
last I found their date, and endeavoured to read them regularly; but it was not
till daylight that I could bring myself to a sufficient degree of composure.
Never were letters more welcome&mdash;never did any yield greater joy and comfort;
they have since formed my chief happiness, and will continue so to do until the
end of our voyage. Had we unfortunately sailed one day sooner, I should have
lost these precious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>letters: judge then how fortunate I think myself,
particularly so at their having been preserved from the wreck of the poor
L'Aigle; as I find that several packages, &amp;c. for this squadron, with the
good things you sent me, shared the fate of the poor ship; Captain Hay having
written to me from Gibraltar that they were put on board her.</p>

<p>Sir Horatio Nelson wrote to me that he had not heard from his family; but, as
Captain Nisbet came in the brig, he will give him accounts from Lady Nelson.</p>

<p>I now come to the sequel of our voyage, having accounted for my being so
<span class="italic">unseasonably</span> disturbed from a sound sleep."</p>

<p>Sir James now received the following letters.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">August 15th, 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>I am not very anxious to receive any persons of the description you mention;
they will all eat our meat, and drink. As they choose to serve the French, there
let them remain. I have not a line from home, all lost in L'Aigle. You will get
off in good time, I dare say. I am sure you will not lose a moment off Cape
Bronte; the shoal extends six miles. If you favour me with a line, direct it for
Naples, where I am going to join the Portuguese squadron. Zealous, Swiftsure,
and the two frigates, I have kept here as long as possible. Nisbet thanks you
for your inquiries. I send you a copy of my letter intended to be sent to Mr.
Nepean; keep it quiet till you get off. Wishing you health, and good passage,</p>

<p class="left75">Believe me ever,<br />
<span class="i2">Your obliged,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p>
<p>I hope Lady S. and all the little ones are well.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>(Copy.)</p>
<p class="right">Secret, for Sir James.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Six of the prizes sailed yesterday with Sir James Saumarez; three
others, viz. Guerrier, Heureux, and Mercure are in the act of
repairing. In this state I received last evening Earl St. Vincent's
most secret orders, and most secret and confidential letters. Thus
situated, it became an important part of my duty to do justice between
my King and country, and the brave officers and men who captured those
ships at the Battle of the Nile. It would have taken one month at
least to fit those ships for a passage to Gibraltar, and not at a
great expense to government, but with the loss to the service of at
least two sail of the line. I therefore feel confident that the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty will, under the present circumstances,
direct that a fair value shall be paid for those ships. I have farther
thought it my duty to tell the squadron the necessity I am under, for
the benefit of the King's service, to order their property to be
destroyed; but that I had no doubt but that government would make a
liberal allowance. I have therefore directed such stores as could,
without taking too much time, be saved from them, and ordered the
hulls to be burned.</p>

<p class="left65">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To Evan Nepean, Esq.</p></div>

<p>The journal of Sir James is thus resumed: "We again weighed anchor,
Wednesday noon; and although with a contrary wind, and ships in a
crippled state, we had the good fortune to clear the land in the night
without accident, and next day lost sight of our ships in the Nile.
Since that period we have not made any great progress; but we have no
reason to complain, and I trust a favourable wind will in due time
waft us down the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"<span class="italic">A pr&eacute;sent, un petit mot sur ma sant&eacute;.</span> In the first place, too great
exertion for two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> days after being under sail, certainly
retarded my perfect recovery, and, added to the excessive heat of the
weather, threw me into a sort of languor that required the three last
days' rest and composure to shake off. I am now, thank God! as well as
ever; and when I consider that every day shortens my distance from
you, my happiness is daily increasing. I have much more to say, <span class="italic">mais
en voil&agrave; assez pour le pr&eacute;sent</span>; and as there is abundance of time
before this can be despatched, <span class="italic">il faut le remettre pour un autre
jour: ainsi adieu</span>!</p>

<p>"Sunday, August 19th.&mdash;I was indeed surprised to find Lyme the place
fixed for your residence; and, on reflection, approve of it highly, as
I believe it is a very healthy place; but more particularly as I hope
to send you a line in going up Channel, and possibly take you to
Spithead. Judge, therefore, the <span class="italic">selfish</span> motives by which I am
actuated, and scold me if you can.</p>

<p>"I was happy our dear boy had reached home before the close of your
last letter, and am charmed with your account of him. Having
understood that there is a good school in Dorsetshire,&mdash;I think at
Sherborne,&mdash;I shall not be surprised if you have placed him there for
the summer, and shall not think it a bad plan to have him nearer to
you. I am glad to find my letters from Gibraltar reached you, and hope
that one or two stragglers will also have come to hand before those
from the Nile arrive. These last will induce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> you to believe our
cruise less unpleasant than you seemed to apprehend,&mdash;more
particularly when you find it the means of bringing the Orion to
England.</p>

<p>"Your <span class="italic">P.S.</span> of the 11th of June is considerably later than any
accounts received in the squadron; indeed, I find very few letters
have been received by any of the captains. The Lion, I understand, is
on her way to join the squadron; but I have reason to believe she has
nothing for me, as she sailed before L'Aigle.</p>

<p>"The accounts from Ireland are truly distressing; but I hope
tranquillity has long since been restored in that distracted country.
We have heard of the dreadful business off Cadiz; but as news from the
fleet must reach home before we can be acquainted with them, I shall
not enlarge on the subject. Captain Grey, I find, is gone to England,
which will have been an agreeable surprise to his amiable lady.</p>

<p>"Now for some account of the Orion and her crew:&mdash;In the first place,
Mr. Barker is on board Le Peuple Souverain, happier than a prince. Mr.
Wells becomes first, in his room; and, as I found it necessary to send
away Mr. &mdash;&mdash; at Syracuse, I should remain with only three lieutenants,
but that, in virtue of my present command, I appointed, the day I left
Admiral Nelson, our kinsman Dumaresq to that station, who acquits
himself with great zeal and assiduity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> He will receive pay for the
time; but cannot be confirmed, from not having served the six required
years.</p>

<p>"All the officers are in rapture at the share the ship had in the
action, except her captain, who is never satisfied. The ship's company
all healthy, and the wounded daily recovering. Sheep and poultry in
abundance; but the fear of a long passage down the Mediterranean
obliges us to be frugal, wishing, if possible, to avoid putting into
any place before we reach the fleet off Cadiz,&mdash;a thing scarcely
possible, and rendered still more improbable from our little progress
the last five days: however,&mdash;<span class="italic">patience</span>!</p>

<p>"I have only two French officers on board; one was second captain of
the Tonnant; they are both in the ward-room, and I occasionally invite
them to my table. Of the six prizes four are fine ships, particularly
the Franklin and Spartiate: the Souverain and Conqu&eacute;rant are both very
old ships; Le Tonnant and L'Aquilon were built within these few years
only. Both the former are quite new. But it is not what we have taken,
but what we have destroyed. We have left France only two sail of the
line in the Mediterranean, except a few bad Venetian ships and some
frigates. A squadron of five sail leaves us masters of these seas,
equal to protect our commerce, and with a few frigates destroy that of
the enemy: these are the real fruits of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> victory; and as to
anything personal to ourselves, the approbation of our country, and
possibly an additional medal, will be ample recompence to us. At
present my chief solicitude is to find things go on well in England;
and I think, when the account of our action arrives, it will set the
minds of people at ease for some time at least.</p>

<p>"I shall have a great deal to say to you, in which you will
acknowledge with me that the Almighty has been kind and bountiful
indeed, beyond my merits or pretensions. You will infer from my late
journal what I particularly allude to, wherein I mention the Orion
having been intended to return to the fleet on the junction of the
reinforcement; which was merely to favour Captain Troubridge, with
whom I clashed from seniority. Very, very fortunately for me, the
enemy's force would not permit Sir H. Nelson to part with me; and the
sequel has shown the partiality of the Earl's proceeding: but of this
'<span class="italic">ci-apr&egrave;s</span>;' only, for the present, judge what must have been my
feelings had I been thus deprived of my share in this action!</p>

<p>"My situation at this moment is exactly what I could wish,&mdash;the
command of a respectable squadron escorting the trophies of our
victory; and I am induced to hope that I shall proceed with them to
England without considerable delay. We have just gained sight of
Cyprus, nearly the track we followed six weeks ago; so invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> do
the westerly winds prevail at this season; but I hope we shall not be
subject to the tedious calms we experienced under Candia. Hitherto we
have always had a good breeze, which has prevented any intercourse
between the ships of the squadron, one day only excepted.</p>

<p>"I have not told you that we all voted a sword to the Admiral before
we parted from the squadron; the captains having agreed to subscribe
fifty pounds each to defray the expense, and to have his picture,
which is to be put up in the room intended to hold the <span class="italic">Egyptian
Club</span>, when we all meet in England. The overplus, which will come to
about thirty pounds each, is to be applied for the relief of the
widows and orphans of those who have nobly fallen in the action. All
this shows unanimity at least, and I believe greater never existed in
any squadron.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 22nd.&mdash;This morning the wind has set in very favourably
for us; but it is to the southward, and produces such a close, sultry,
and damp air, that it is scarcely bearable; and, with all this, we
have to encounter so strong a western swell, that the prizes and
crippled ships, for want of more sail, can scarcely contend against
it. What if we should have the good fortune to fall in with the four
French ships! They are certainly on their way to Toulon; and, from the
want of water and provisions, must have put into some of the ports in
these seas. I <span class="italic">dreamt</span> so much of them last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> night that I really form
great hopes of our falling in with them. This leads me to mention that
all the captains agreed to share together in whatever may be captured
till the 1st of October.</p>

<p>"It is now exactly three weeks since the Battle of the Nile; it
appears almost an age; but when once we get in the fair track down the
Mediterranean, every day will, I hope, shorten our distance. We have
seen but one strange sail since we left Bequir, and that at too great
a distance to speak with. I think it probable Sir Horatio may be on
his way to Naples, as he proposed to sail soon to join the Portuguese
squadron, taking with him the Culloden, Alexander, and Goliath. The
Zealous, with Swiftsure, and the frigates, were to be left to block up
Alexandria, and distress the enemy. What barbarous people we must be,
after having done them so much mischief, still to add to their
disasters!</p>

<p>"August 24th.&mdash;I have been right in my conjectures this morning,
having fallen in with Sir Horatio, who obligingly sent the Bonne
Citoyenne with letters, &amp;c. for the ships with me, brought by the
Seahorse, which joined him at Bequir. He has only the Culloden and
Alexander with him, having left the rest of the ships for the good
purposes before mentioned. This meeting has afforded me an opportunity
of sending you a few hurried lines, which I have requested the Admiral
to forward from Naples. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> have no doubt that the letter will reach
you some time before any other I can have an opportunity of sending
you.</p>

<p>"I think the few last lines will not be the less acceptable for having
been anticipated. I can assure you their purport is highly acceptable,
as I now have the Earl's own assertion for the Orion being ordered to
England upon his own terms, 'when I join him with the prizes.' Alas!
they get on very slowly; but I am endowed with unparalleled patience,
having scarcely uttered a murmur on their tardiness, so perfectly
satisfied am I with the prospect before me.</p>

<p>"I understand the Seahorse has taken La Sensible, and the Lion a
Spanish frigate: <span class="italic">&agrave; propos</span>, we have received intimation that a
Spanish squadron is on its way to Leghorn, to convey his holiness Pope
Pius the Sixth to some part of Spain; and, in case of our falling in
with them, we are to treat him with all the ceremony and respect due
to the sovereign pontiff.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 26th.&mdash;I went yesterday on board the Admiral, for
half-an-hour; and was happy at finding him in perfect health. He will
ever retain the mark on his forehead which he has so honourably
acquired; mine is not quite in so <span class="italic">distinguished a place</span>, but I also
expect to have a scar on my left side, or rather on the hip-bone,
which was slightly grazed; but it is now perfectly healed, and I
reflect with great gratitude on the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> narrow escape I had: my only
fear is, that it will give you great uneasiness when the account
reaches you. I did not intend to have my name inserted in the return
of wounded, but the Admiral desired it should; so that he must share
the blame if it should have alarmed you.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you all the fine projects I form for some months at
least after my arrival in England. This last business has so shattered
the poor Orion, that she will not, without considerable repair, be in
a state for more service; and if I can be so fortunate as to obtain Le
Franklin with my officers and men, she will be getting forward during
the winter months, and I shall have the enjoyment of your society all
that time: and I think, if it pleases God to bless our arms in England
with success, the enemy will be brought to sue for a peace before the
spring of next year. Their great inducement for carrying on the war
was their hopes of success from this expedition, which is considered
as entirely frustrated, as their army will be too much reduced to
attempt to go to India without being reinforced from France; and they
never will be able to prevail on more troops to embark for Egypt, even
if they had the means of conveyance for them.</p>

<p>"The winds prove all this time very variable, <span class="italic">et nous avan&ccedil;ons fort
lentement</span>.</p>

<p>"The Admiral is still in sight, though we are not in company together.
Had I not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> certain of going to England, I should regret losing
the opportunity of seeing Naples, particularly on this occasion; but
everything is absorbed in that first consideration. The newspapers are
at all times acceptable, and I was happy when you found opportunities
to send them from Ryde; but as many of the squadron receive them, and
they are always circulated to the different ships, I would not trouble
you to send them. <span class="italic">D'ailleurs, pour le pr&eacute;sent, j'esp&egrave;re que ce serait
inutile.</span></p>

<p>"Monday.&mdash;We get on very slowly indeed, not having yet got sight of
Candia; we must however have <span class="italic">patience</span>. Three days' fair wind will
bring us the distance of Sicily. I have invited Captains Miller,
Louis, and Gould to dine with me to-day. To the former I said that
your ladyship had the pleasure of having made acquaintance with Mrs.
Miller. Miller is an excellent man. Another day I shall have the other
captains, Derby, Peyton, and Cuthbert, late first lieutenant of the
Majestic.</p>

<p>"Whilst I am writing, a fine breeze has sprung up, which will get us
as far as Rhodes at least. We have entirely lost sight of the Admiral;
and I think, from the wind having favoured us, that we shall have
considerably the start of his little squadron.</p>

<p>"Tuesday.&mdash;Nothing so uncertain and variable as the winds in this
country. We are still off the island of Rhodes, which appears fertile
and well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> cultivated. We have also sight of Candia at the distance of
above thirty leagues. Our present route is different from any of the
former, as we go to the northward of Candia, amidst the innumerable
islands that form the archipelago. It is thought by many a dangerous
navigation with our disabled ships, but I always consider <span class="italic">que le bon
Dieu nous guide</span>.</p>

<p>"The Admiral has again joined us, but too far off for any personal
communication. This evening we have effected a great object in
doubling Rhodes, and we are now proceeding with a fine breeze. I hope
in three days to congratulate you on our being in the fair track down
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>"Friday, 31st.&mdash;Events multiply and increase upon us, but not so
favourably as they promised when I last took up my pen. After
contending for three days against the baffling winds we had so often
experienced, and by our perseverance gained a considerable distance,
the wind increased so much against us yesterday morning, that I was
compelled, from the disabled state of several of the ships, to abandon
my intention of going to the northward of Candia; and, not without
great risk, we ran through a passage imperfectly explored, and never
known to ships of war till we found it practicable: at the same time,
I almost shudder at the danger we escaped; nothing but a case of
extreme necessity could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> justified the attempt, and Providence
was our guide;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> at the same time warning us of the danger we ran,
having actually seen the breakers, and escaped them by a trifling
distance; and this was performed late at night, all the ships
following and guided by our lights.</p>

<p>"We are at present close to Candia, and the Admiral in sight; rather
in advance of us, owing to the circumstance I have related. I now fear
our voyage will prove very tedious, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> the want of provisions
and other circumstances will compel us to put into some port; this may
occasion great delay, which the approach of the equinox makes me very
desirous to avoid. I really believe no ships in so bad a condition as
those with me ever attempted so intricate a navigation.</p>

<p>"September 1st.&mdash;You are certainly unapprised of the Orion being on
her way to England. Here have we been occupied for three weeks in
effecting what might be accomplished in two days. Your wishes, I
think, would prove more availing were you acquainted with the real
state of things. This extraordinary delay makes me more fractious than
can be imagined, and I begin to lose the character for patience which
I had given myself by so tiresome a situation; besides which, I have
Le Peuple Souverain to drag after me, that causes me more trouble than
even the Spanish <span class="italic">saints</span> did after the 14th of February.</p>

<p>"Sunday.&mdash;I had almost determined not to resume my pen till we were
entirely clear of this same island of Candia; but we have made such
great progress since yesterday, and the prospect continues so
favourable, that I cannot refuse myself the satisfaction of
congratulating you thereon.</p>

<p>"I received last evening a letter from the Admiral, brought me by La Bonne
Citoyenne.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>is desirous of having the Minotaur and Audacious detached to
Naples after accompanying us as far on our way as Minorca. A vessel was
yesterday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> spoken with that saw one of the French line-of-battle ships, with the
loss of her main-mast, and towed by a frigate towards Corfu, only eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> days
since; so that, had the winds favoured us, we should have been at no great
distance from them. I dined to-day in the ward-room; but I am sorry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> to say we
had no church this morning; this is so very necessary a duty, that I am always
grieved when it is omitted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thursday, 6th September.&mdash;The last four days we have got on
remarkably well; and, what is still better, the wind seems now set in
very favourably. Late last night the Thalia joined me, after cruising
in all directions to fall in with Sir Horatio. I was not disappointed
at receiving no letters by her: but this morning, having been joined
by the Flora cutter, that left England the 26th July, and the fleet
off Cadiz so late as the 12th August, I own it gave me concern to
receive no tidings from you; but, on recollection that all the letters
for this ship have been kept back, from our being expected down the
Mediterranean, my disappointment ceases.</p>

<p>"I have seen nothing of Admiral Nelson since I last wrote; and, as our
route now lies in a different direction, I do not expect to meet with
him again. The information obtained by the above vessels is of a very
satisfactory nature; and I trust things will soon, very soon, draw to
a favourable crisis.</p>

<p>"The Thalia brought me from Bequir several intercepted letters from
France, taken in a corvette going to Alexandria. I have read several
of them, and find that their chief reliance was placed in the
expedition to Egypt; which having failed so completely, must
disconcert all their future projects. One bad piece of news I have
learnt,&mdash;'that a Spanish vessel we took off St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> Pierre, laden with
wheat, has been recaptured by a French privateer.'</p>

<p>"I have been occupied for some days past in putting my cabin in good
repair, which I hope to have fit for your ladyship's reception, so
that, on my arrival in the Channel, I may have only to despatch the
first vessel I fall in with to Lyme, with an invitation for you to
partake of it, accompanied by one or more of the children, and any
servants you may please to require to attend upon you. This has for
some time past engaged my attention, and I trust nothing will
intervene to thwart my expectations. Alas! they have been but too much
disappointed already by the adverse winds, which still continue to
weary our patience.</p>

<p>"I dined to-day on board the Minotaur, the weather having proved
nearly calm; it is the first time since we left Bequir that I have
consented to leave the ship. I hope to fall in with the Colossus and
some victuallers, which I find, by the Flora, were on their way to our
squadron, supposing us to have been off Malta, blockading the French
fleet. Strange that at so late a period Earl St. Vincent had not
obtained information of their having sailed from that island!</p>

<p>"Sunday.&mdash;The wind always continues contrary; but we get on,
notwithstanding, by slow degrees. I made up for last Sunday, and had
Divine service performed, and dined in the ward-room. We obtained a
small supply of stock from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> the Thalia when she joined us; I should
have told you that I despatched her and the cutter towards Naples, to
meet Sir Horatio.</p>

<p>"Tuesday evening.&mdash;The wind has at last favoured us for a few hours,
and to-morrow I hope to be in sight of Syracuse. A vessel was
yesterday spoken with, that had an ambassador on board from
Constantinople, going to the different states in Barbary, to direct
them to arm against the French. An English frigate had arrived at the
Sublime Porte with the news of the defeat of their fleet at
Alexandria; but I am at a loss to conjecture what the frigate was. The
French officers "<span class="italic">sont indign&eacute;s de cette insulte offerte &agrave; la grande
nation</span>."</p>

<p>"Thursday.&mdash;We at last gained sight of Mount &AElig;tna yesterday evening;
but the winds still prove very contrary, and I fear we shall be
obliged, much against my inclination, to put into either Syracuse or
Messina: we are at present off the former place. By a boat that has
joined one of the ships, I find they only heard of the battle four
days ago. They are disposed to give us a hearty welcome, but I hope we
shall have no occasion for their well-meant intentions.</p>

<p>"Friday.&mdash;We last night fell in with the Marquis de Niza's squadron,
on their return from the mouth of the Nile. The Marquis hailed me that
he was <span class="italic">very sorry</span> he had not arrived a few days sooner. We were much
better without him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir James sent, by the Thalia, the following letters to Sir Horatio:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, Port of Augusta, 16th September 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>I fear you will be disappointed at finding that we are no further on our voyage
than this place. We were three days in sight of Sicily, endeavouring to beat
round Cape Pesaro; and, Friday afternoon, the wind set in so strong to the
westward, that I was obliged to endeavour to get into Syracuse, but I found the
wind directly out of the harbour, and stood again to the southward. It blew a
gale all night; and in the morning, seeing no possibility of getting into
Syracuse, I bore up for this place, where the squadron anchored yesterday
afternoon. We are completing the water with all expedition, but I am
disappointed that there is no wine to be had but at a very high price. We are
supplied with bullocks and other articles the same as at Syracuse; and, as at
that place, the people are exorbitant in their demands. Every possible attention
has been shown by the governor. I paid him a visit of ceremony this morning with
the other captains of the squadron. He appears a man of the first
respectability.</p>

<p>I thought it proper to mention to him that I had seen Mr. Acton's letter, which
stated that his Majesty's ships were to be received in the ports of this island;
and I should do him great injustice, did I not observe to you, sir, his earnest
endeavours that we should be supplied with everything we require on the most
reasonable terms.</p>

<p>A vessel, which left Malta six days ago, reports that the inhabitants have
revolted against the French, who are driven to the greatest stress by the want
of provisions. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>They seem very anxious for the appearance of an English squadron
off that island.</p>

<p>I hope to have the squadron completed in water by Wednesday next, and to put to
sea the same evening. The Spartiate has caused us considerable uneasiness,
having unfortunately got aground by bordering too near the light-house. She was
however got off without sustaining any damage. All your friends, with me, desire
their best compliments.</p>

<p class="left55">I am, my dear Admiral,<br />
<span class="i2">Your ever faithful and obedient servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Sir Horatio Nelson.</p>

<p class="right">Orion, Augusta, 20th September 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>I feel great satisfaction in acquainting you that the squadron and all the
prizes are completed with water, and will be ready to proceed to sea at daylight
to-morrow morning. The westerly winds have prevailed ever since our arrival, and
I fear still continue in the channel of Malta; but it is of such importance to
get from this place before easterly winds set in, that not a moment has been
lost in getting the ships forward, which must be evident to you when you
consider our great demands for water, and that we have only four boats in the
squadron to supply the ships. We have been abundantly supplied with fresh
provisions, and each ship takes twelve or fourteen bullocks to sea; but wine was
not to be had at any reasonable rate. We have found difficulty in obtaining cash
for the articles purchased on account of Government in a place where there
scarcely exists any trade, and where the inhabitants are extremely poor. The
governor has offered us every possible assistance; and I must entreat you will
represent to Mr. Acton <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>the zeal and earnest endeavours he has shown to forward
the King's service. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Sir Horatio Nelson.</p></div>

<p>"Saturday, 22nd September.&mdash;A whole week has elapsed since I closed
the account of our voyage; having the following day been under the
necessity, from the state of the weather, to put into Augusta, a port
a few leagues from Syracuse. We sailed thence yesterday, after
completing the squadron with water. We found abundance of provisions,
and each ship has sailed with a dozen or fourteen oxen, besides sheep,
fowls, &amp;c. Augusta is a more modern town than Syracuse, having been
rebuilt after an earthquake thirty years ago. It has no trade, and the
inhabitants are extremely poor; the ships were visited by them daily,
but we went to very few parties on shore. A few leagues from Augusta
there is a considerable town called Catania. I regretted much it was
not in my power to visit it, as there we might have had many things
that would have been very acceptable in England.</p>

<p>"In passing Syracuse yesterday, several of the principal inhabitants
came on board; and I was happy in sending a letter to you, enclosed to
Admiral Nelson at Naples. I hope to be with you as soon as it arrives,
having still every expectation of being in England in the month of
October.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> My mind is much more at ease since we have obtained the last
supplies, as a small quantity of salt provisions, which we can have
from the fleet, will enable the ships to proceed for England without
stopping at Gibraltar, or any other place; and if the Orion is not of
the number, great will be my disappointment.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 27th of September.&mdash;I have been very much engaged on public
business of great importance the last three days, which, I am sorry to
say, has not turned out quite equal to my wishes. On Monday I fell in
with the Marquis de Niza's squadron, which had been ordered off Malta
by Admiral Nelson. On Tuesday a deputation of the principal
inhabitants came on board the Orion, to solicit a supply of arms and
ammunition; at the same time informing me that the French garrison
were in the greatest distress, and that, if the town was summoned,
they had good grounds to believe they would be induced to surrender. I
waited on the Marquis de Niza, who readily concurred in sending a flag
of truce with proposals to the French garrison. After three hours'
deliberation they returned a very concise answer,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which although
not satisfactory at this time, leaves little doubt that they will be
compelled to surrender very shortly. Before I came away, I supplied
the inhabitants, from the prizes, with twelve hundred muskets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> and a
great quantity of ammunition, of which they were in great want. I only
regretted it was not in my power to stay a few days off the island.
The Guillaume Tell and two frigates are in the harbour, and must fall
with the garrison. A report prevailed that Le G&eacute;n&eacute;reux was lost; these
ships form the remaining force that escaped us from the mouth of the
Nile.</p>

<p>"We are now pursuing our voyage with slow steps; but, as the light
winds lead us in the fair track, we must not complain. I was glad to
learn from the Marquis de Niza that the Colossus was seen going to
Naples, with four victuallers and a store-ship. A frigate is now in
sight, joining me, by which I hope to receive good accounts.</p>

<p>"Friday morning.&mdash;The frigate proved to be the Terpsichore, from the
Admiral, whom she left ten days ago going to Naples. The Terpsichore
was going off Malta for intelligence, and to look out for the
Colossus, with the victuallers. As I could satisfy the Admiral on both
those points, I despatched her immediately for Naples. We have now a
fine Siroc wind, attended with all its usual close dampness; but, as
it wafts us down the Mediterranean, we readily put up with its
disagreeable attendants, without the risk of hanging ourselves. I
intend to part with the Minotaur and Audacious to-day, agreeably to my
orders. Fortunately, I exchanged their men from the prizes two days
ago, as it would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> attended with danger to do it in the
present weather. We have taken our final leave of Sicily this morning.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 30th Sept. The weather has proved very unfavourable the last
three days. Le Souverain has sustained some disasters, and causes me
great uneasiness. I hope, in another week, to get the distance of
Gibraltar, where we may all be better refitted. I cannot be too
thankful for the supplies we obtained at Augusta; the squadron would
otherwise have been much distressed for want of water and provisions.
We are in sight of Sardinia, with every appearance of a favourable
breeze. To-morrow we enter the ever propitious month. I still hope my
expectations will be fulfilled; although I own that probability is
against their accomplishment.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 4th October.&mdash;This month began most auspiciously with a
fine breeze of wind, which continued all the following day; but
yesterday morning we experienced a tremendous gale to the northward,
with a very heavy sea, which still continues: the wind has again
shifted favourably, and I hope this time will carry us through the
Straits; but we have had so many disappointments that we must not
trust to appearances.</p>

<p>"Saturday, 6th.&mdash;The winds prove again contrary for us. We have the
Souverain in tow, and in so bad a condition that I almost fear it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
will not be possible to get her as far as Gibraltar. There has been a
great deal of blowing weather, with heavy seas, since we left Malta,
and the prizes have suffered considerably from it. I have had an
addition to my stock since I left Augusta, having three fine little
lambs; and I understand more are expected: it is fortunate I was well
provided, as this increase would have proved ruinous to my table.</p>

<p>"Monday, 8th October.&mdash;We have had variable winds these last two days,
which have brought the squadron a considerable distance. We are at
present off Algiers, a very unfriendly coast, which I hope soon to
lose sight of with our present breeze. The anchorage off Cadiz having
broken up about this time last year, I depend on finding Lord St.
Vincent at anchor at Gibraltar, or there to find orders to join him at
Lisbon, and from thence to proceed to England.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, 9th.&mdash;I congratulate you on our darling's birth-day; and
join my prayers to yours that Heaven may bestow on him its choicest
blessings.</p>

<p>"We have a continuance of fine wind, which, I trust, will carry us to
Gibraltar in two days. I have been treated with the perusal of several
French papers, which I intercepted on board a Danish vessel from
Marseilles, bound to Algiers. They are dated so late as the 27th
Fructidor, which answers to the 13th September; and I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> happy to
see, by the English news they contain, that things were going on
favourably. I hope soon to have it under your hand more particularly:
in the mean time it is very satisfactory to receive these news, which
are near three months of later date from England than we before
possessed; your dear letter of the 10th June being the latest I have
seen.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 10th.&mdash;I fell in with L'Espoir this morning. She left
Gibraltar ten days ago. She has surprised me with the account that the
Leander had not at that time reached Earl St. Vincent; and that the
news of our victory was only received two days before by the Mutine,
which had arrived from Naples. This account has created amongst us
great uneasiness for the fate of the Leander. I have despatched
L'Espoir with a letter to Earl St. Vincent, apprising him of the
approach of the prizes, with the ships under my command; and I hope to
receive his lordship's orders for our proceedings when we appear off
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>"Saturday, 13th.&mdash;The wind has again set against us the last two days,
and continues to exercise our patience. What adds to my uneasiness is,
the small quantity of provisions in the squadron. We have been at
short allowance these six weeks; and should it unfortunately continue
to the westward a few days longer, we shall be very badly off. I now
very reluctantly give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> up all hope of being in England during this
month.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 14th.&mdash;The wind has again sprung up to the eastward, and I
hope will this time carry us to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>"Monday, 15th.&mdash;The wind still continues favourable, and to-morrow I
hope to anchor in Gibraltar Bay; and, as an opportunity may offer to
send you this tedious journal, I hold it in readiness accordingly. It
will give you some faint idea of the trial our patience has been put
to; and although our progress has not been attended with the same
anxiety as I described in my former journal, when we were in pursuit
of the enemy, still I have not been exempt from great uneasiness on
various accounts, particularly from the crippled state of most of the
ships, in a navigation some part of which is very hazardous, and where
contrary winds so invariably prevail. I now hope in a short time to be
released from so heavy a charge, and that I shall be permitted to
proceed, as I have been given to expect, <span class="italic">immediately for England</span>.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, 16th.&mdash;We have gained sight of Gibraltar this morning; but
westerly winds and the current prevent our approach to it. I hope,
however, to have communication with the Rock to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 18th.&mdash;I received late last evening a very flattering
letter from Earl St. Vincent, in answer to mine of the 10th, which, he
says, diffused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> universal joy to the garrison, and the little squadron
with him: and his lordship has rejoiced my heart by informing me that
so soon as the wounded and sick are landed from the squadron, and the
wants of the ships are supplied, I shall proceed to Lisbon with them.
He adds that, in his judgment, our action stands foremost in the page
of naval history, having, beyond all dispute, achieved more than was
ever done before, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"We are still struggling against adverse winds, not without hope of
gaining the anchorage to-morrow. I most sincerely wish it, on every
account; and, although my next rendezvous is not what I exactly
expected, it always brings me nearer England.</p>

<p>"Great is our uneasiness for the fate of the Leander. In the letter
above alluded to, Lord St. Vincent thinks it probable she may have
been dismasted, and have put into one of the islands of the
Archipelago. I own my fears for her are great." The following is Lord
St. Vincent's letter, with Sir James's answer.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Gibraltar, 16th October 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir, </p>

<p>Your letter of the 10th instant, received yesterday, has diffused universal joy
through the garrison and little squadron now here. I highly applaud and admire
the measures taken by you and Rear-admiral the Marquis de Niza to induce the
French to surrender their stronghold in Malta; and the supply of arms and
ammunition you furnished the islanders with was very judicious. Two very
respectable Moorish merchants, natives of the eastern <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>coast of Barbary, who
arrived at Gibraltar from Genoa yesterday, report that advices had been received
at the latter place before they left it, that the Maltese had succeeded, and put
the French garrison to the sword. I have been so long accustomed to the fallacy
of <span class="italic">pratique</span> reports, that I do not give entire credit to this.</p>

<p>Of the Leander we know nothing; and I am rather inclined to believe that the
story Sir Horatio Nelson learned from a Candia boat, is true; and that she has
either been dismasted in the action, or so crippled as to be obliged to take
refuge in one of the islands of the Archipelago. I never despair, and I have
great confidence that she will yet turn up.</p>

<p>The account you give from Captain Retallick, of the near approach to Naples of
the Colossus and her precious charge,&mdash;for the Alliance is full of naval
stores, with all the top-masts and top-sail yards we had, and the four
victuallers loaded with new provisions of every species except bread,&mdash;is a
communication of the utmost consequence.</p>

<p>It is my anxious wish that the six prize ships of war should be safe moored in
the Tagus as soon as possible; and my intention that the Orion, Defence, and
Theseus shall accompany them: the Bellerophon and Majestic to enter Gibraltar
Mole in order to be remasted, for all the lower masts are there; and their men,
after assisting in the navigation of the prizes to Lisbon, may return hither in
the Santa Dorothea.</p>

<p>I am fitting out an expedition of great importance,&mdash;I believe, <span class="italic">entre nous</span>,
against Monte Video, or Lima,&mdash;which swallows up all the transports and
frigates I have, or I would send you some salt provisions and wine. Should the
Levanters fail you, by working close to the Barbary shore you will soon reach
Tetuan Bay, and find no difficulty in working round Europa with a flood-tide.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>I request you will convey to your brave companions in arms, that, in my
judgment, they stand foremost in the page of naval history; having, beyond all
dispute, achieved more than was ever done before, and, under the critical
circumstances of the times, have certainly rendered the greatest benefit to the
human race at large, and to their King and country in particular, that ever was
performed.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be, with great esteem and regard,<br />
<span class="i2">Sir,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your most obedient, humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span> </p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p>
<p> P.S. Doctor Harness has prepared the naval hospital for the reception of the
wounded and sick of your squadron in the best manner our means will admit; the
wards have been whitewashed, and every exertion made to purify them. The moment
the invalids are landed, and the wants of the ships that go to Lisbon supplied,
you shall proceed thither with them. <span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p class="right">Orion, off Gibraltar, 18th Oct. 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I received late last evening the honour of your letter by L'Espoir, and shall
not fail to communicate to the squadron the very handsome terms in which your
lordship is pleased to express yourself of the action of the Nile. I am
particularly happy the measures taken off Malta meet with your lordship's
approbation; but I fear the account from Genoa is premature respecting the
French garrison, as there has scarcely been time since we left the island, the
26th Sept. for the news to reach Genoa, and arrive at Gibraltar, if such an
event had taken place.</p>

<p>Fearing that, with the ship I have in tow, it will not be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>possible to reach
Rozia Bay till a late hour, I send an officer on shore with the despatches for
your lordship, and the letters for the garrison.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be, my lord,<br />
<span class="i2">Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To the Right Hon. Earl St. Vincent.</p></div>

<p>The squadron arrived at Gibraltar on the evening of the 18th, amidst
the universal and unbounded acclamations of the assembled population.</p>

<p>"Sunday, 21st Oct.&mdash;Last Thursday, my dear love, we all anchored in
safety in this bay, and met with a reception we want words to express
from the governor, admiral, officers, soldiers, seamen, and
inhabitants. We can never do justice to the warmth of their applause,
and the praises they all bestowed on our squadron.</p>

<p>"A ball was given last night by the governor, in honour of our
victory; and we have a round of dinner invitations from the heads of
the garrison. I am, however, happy to tell you that to-morrow I expect
to put to sea for Lisbon, with the Theseus and prizes, which I am to
leave in safety in the Tagus, and then proceed to England. I am to
give a passage to the Duc d'Havr&eacute; and his suite: he is a nobleman of
distinction, who has resided some time in Spain, but has been expelled
from that country with other <span class="italic">emigr&eacute;s</span>. I had an opportunity of
sending you, by a cutter for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> Lagos, a short letter, with the above
pleasing accounts, which I am persuaded will yield no less happiness
to you than it has to me."</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the honours, the titles, the decorations,
and the favours conferred on the victorious Nelson, as also the
praises he had himself bestowed on some of the captains of the fleet;
but we cannot refrain from reverting to the extraordinary circumstance
that the second in command in that battle, which both Earl St. Vincent
and Mr. Pitt declared "stands foremost in the page of naval history,"
and which (as before stated), was most highly extolled, had not that
mark of distinction conferred upon him, which is usually granted on
such occasions. In common, indeed, with the other captains, he
received a gold medal; being only the second given to him, although he
commanded a ship of the line in four great general actions, and served
in two others.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> We mention this, because Sir James was not aware of
the extent of this neglect until many years after, when, meeting with
Clarke and Mac Arthur's Life of Nelson, he discovered that Nelson's
letters had influenced the Admiralty to regard him as having held no
higher station in the action than any other captain in the squadron,
and represented Sir Thomas Troubridge, who unfortunately had no part
in the battle, as equally entitled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> to reward as himself: therefore he
felt this deviation from the common usage less severely at the time
than he would otherwise have done.</p>

<p>We admit that it would be difficult to point out a situation of
extraordinary hardship more peculiarly calculated, than that of
Troubridge, to excite the feelings of sympathy expressed so strongly
by Nelson.</p>

<p>But what would have been the situation,&mdash;what would have been the
feelings of Sir James Saumarez, had he been sent away to make room for
Sir Thomas Troubridge? We leave the reader to judge. Suffice it to
say, that as soon as the Admiral had ascertained the real force of the
enemy, he found the Orion could not be spared, by which fortunate
circumstance Sir James was saved a mortification which would have
weighed on his heart the remainder of his days.</p>

<p>Every admiral, captain, and officer, with whom we have conversed on
the subject, has been decidedly of opinion that the name of Saumarez
ought to have been honourably mentioned; and that, as second in
command, some mark of distinction should have been conferred upon him.
We dwell on this subject particularly, because we know, that when a
brave and meritorious officer does not obtain the reward due to his
merit, it is extremely injurious to the service, as it damps that
ardour after fame, and weakens that emulation, which lead to valour
and enterprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> May every succeeding Nelson regard, and be able to
look up to, that motto which was conferred on the hero of the
Nile,&mdash;<span class="italic">Palmam qui meruit, ferat!</span></p>

<p>On Sir James's arrival at Gibraltar he received the following letters
from Sir Horatio Nelson, approving of his proceedings:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Vanguard, Naples, 29th Sept. 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received your letter of the 17th from Augusta, as well as your despatch
of the 27th, by Captain Gage.</p>

<p>I very much approve of your putting into Augusta to get water, and very highly
so of your officer-like behaviour and conduct relative to Malta, as also of your
supplying the Maltese with arms and ammunition.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i2">Your most obedient servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p>

<hr class="c15"  />
<p class="right">September 29th, 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>Captain Gage is just arrived with your letters and papers relative to Malta. I
can say with truth there is no action of your life, as far as relates to me, but
what must be entirely to my approbation: your summons to Malta is highly proper;
and you have done as I wished in sending the arms, &amp;c. The wind here is
strong at S.E. I hope you have it, and that it will carry you through the
Straits. This is a sad place for refitting, the swell sets in so heavy; never
again do we come to Naples: besides the rest, we are killed with kindness.
Wishing you, my dear Sir James, every felicity in this world, believe me ever,</p>

<p class="left60">Your obliged and affectionate,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>Sir James Saumarez.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>At Gibraltar Sir James also received a letter from his gallant friend
and brother-in-arms, Captain Ball, which gives so vivid a description
of some of the events of this most eventful period of the war, that we
are persuaded the reader will thank us for inserting it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Alexander, at sea, 11th Oct. 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>I have the satisfaction of sending you, by the Colossus, a case containing six
fan-mounts, two boxes of perfumery, four large and two small of Naples soap,
amounting to eighteen Spanish dollars and a half. I hope to collect from Sicily
some ornamental figures for a table, which I will forward to you, by the first
safe conveyance, with some Neapolitan shawls. I shall not draw upon your agent,
as I expect, when I return to Naples, to receive nearly forty pounds as your
share of the cotton and articles taken out of the Spanish polacre we captured.
Pray let me know to whom I shall remit the balance. I sincerely hope that you
had a good passage down, and have not suffered from the fatigue and anxiety you
must have experienced. I make no doubt but you will have the pleasure of
convoying the ships to England, where you will be amply recompensed by a joyful
meeting with Lady Saumarez and your family. When you get your second medal,
beware of the ladies, if they hear such a story of you as of our friend
Collingwood. I shall feel very much flattered whenever you will favour me with a
line; and you may be assured that I shall never lose an occasion of testifying
to you my great esteem, and how very much I value your friendship. I enclose
herewith a translation of Admiral Blanquet's account of the battle of the Nile,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>with his plans, which he is to present to the French Minister of the Marine.
One of my officers copied them unknown to him, but his aide-de-camp allowed
everybody to read them.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe to you the very flattering reception we met
with at Naples. Our gallant Admiral was hailed as the saviour of Italy. He daily
receives from all parts congratulatory addresses and verses, celebrating his
fame. The King visited him before he anchored, and he gave him and all the
captains a very elegant dinner on board one of his ships of the line. We dined
on the poop; the party very select, consisting of the hereditary Prince and one
of his brothers, the Minister of Marine, three of the Lords in waiting, Sir
William and Lady Hamilton, and the captain of the Neapolitan ship. After dinner,
the King gave as a toast, "Sir Horatio Nelson and the brave English nation,"
with a salute from his lower deck guns. Sir William Hamilton gave a f&ecirc;te that
cost more than a thousand pounds. It was much admired for its taste and
magnificence. There was nothing to be seen or heard of but "Viva Nelson!" The
English nation never stood so high in the estimation of the Italians as at this
present moment: and I believe the French were never so universally execrated and
despised as they now are. The Emperor and King of Naples will make an effort to
drive them out of Italy. General Mack was daily expected at Naples to arrange
the plans.</p>

<p>We have to regret the capture of the Leander by the G&eacute;n&eacute;reux. She is carried
into Corfu. Of course all our letters by her are destroyed, and our friends will
suffer much anxiety until the arrival of Capel, who could not get there before
the 20th of last month. The grand Seignior declared war against the French the
1st of last month. He did not receive the Admiral's official account <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>of the
action until the 6th ult. He has ordered a costly diamond to be presented to him
for the important victory.</p>

<p>Buonaparte's career is nearly finished. He will soon be surrounded by sixty
thousand men. One of his colonels, whom Foley took very lately, says that the
whole army will soon perish. He sent to Alexandria for all the troops in
garrison to join him without loss of time, which they refused doing. The seamen
marched to retrieve their character, but I do not think many will return to tell
of their exploits. A Turkish fleet is gone for Alexandria. Our Envoy at
Constantinople, Sir Sidney Smith's brother, has gained great credit by his
ability and judicious conduct. I had great satisfaction in reading some of his
correspondence. We expect very soon to be in possession of Malta, Corfu, Zante,
and Cerigo. I shall then hope to go to England, Sir H. Nelson having given me
reason to expect the pleasure of carrying home Sir William and Lady Hamilton.</p>

<p>I am now in company with the Colossus, going off Malta, which we are in sight
of. Captain Murray talks of staying to ascertain the state of the island. He is
then to proceed to join Lord St. Vincent. He has this moment made the signal for
Gibraltar; I must therefore refer you to him for the state of Malta. The French
must surrender in a few days. Their ships mean to slip out and trust to their
sailing. Believe me,</p>

<p class="left55">With true esteem and regard,<br />
<span class="i2">My dear Sir James, very sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Alex. M. Ball.</span></p>
<p>Sir James Saumarez, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>To return to Sir James's journal:</p>

<p>"19th October.&mdash;Your valued letters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> 21st July and 29th August
I received the morning of my arrival, and they gave me real comfort
after so long a privation. I now trust that, in a few weeks, we shall
be re-united, no more to part! It is my firm intention to remain, for
some time at least, entirely abstracted from active service. If I can
do so, and retain the command of the ship, well and good; if not, I
shall apply to be superseded.</p>

<p>"An expedition under Sir John Duckworth is now sailing from this bay;
various are the conjectures on its destination. I need not tell you,
after what I have noticed respecting the Earl, that we are on a very
good footing. Indeed, the solicitous attention he shows to me almost
overwhelms me, as I wish to keep clear of laying myself under
obligation, except as far as concerns the promotion of my officers.</p>

<p>"24th October, Orion, off Cadiz.&mdash;Yesterday I got clear of Gibraltar
Bay with the Theseus and five of the prizes, it having been decided,
the morning before we sailed, to leave the Souverain for a hulk at
Gibraltar, which I had strongly recommended before.</p>

<p>"I was fortunate in the arrival of the Transfer brig, in ten days from
Naples, a few hours previous to our sailing. She brought the sad news
of the capture of the Leander, with the despatches; but having long
before given her over for lost, and being apprehensive for the safety
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> all on board, the account rather gave me satisfaction, especially
as she is said to have well supported the fame of the Nile squadron,
though the details of the action are not known.</p>

<p>"Earl St. Vincent afforded me the perusal of several interesting
letters that came by the Transfer from Naples, particularly from the
envoy and our gallant Admiral: he was on the point of sailing for
Malta, which, there is scarcely a doubt, is by this time, entirely in
possession of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>"We are going on with a fine breeze for Lisbon, which I hope to reach
before Saturday. This morning I gained sight of our squadron off
Cadiz; and, although within a few miles of one of the ships, (the
Hector,) they had not the curiosity to join us, and I was unwilling to
be delayed by going to them, although I should have been happy to have
had communication with some of the ships. I hope my stay at Lisbon
will be but short; as, after I embark the Duc d'Havr&eacute;, and have seen
the prizes taken care of, I proceed immediately for Portsmouth. Judge
then of my feelings. My only regret is, being unable to impart them to
you!</p>

<p>"Thursday.&mdash;Early this morning I fell in with the Barfleur and
Northumberland. Although not without great difficulty, I persevered in
my endeavours to join them; but, to my great concern, I found no
letters for me on board either ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> Captain Dacres tells me he wrote
to Ryde, thinking you were there, but in vain. Lady Parker, however,
assured him that she had a letter from you very lately.</p>

<p>"I was glad to hear Captain Capel had reached England with the
accounts of our action, the news of which were received at Portsmouth
the day before the Barfleur sailed.</p>

<p>"Fortune has, as usual, proved propitious this month. What think you
of two vessels, with valuable cargoes from Genoa, which promise to
give, at the most moderate computation, at least &pound;10,000 between
Captain Miller and myself!<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The Theseus joined me with one
yesterday noon, and we brought the other to, some time after; both
under Greek colours, but unquestionably laden with the property of
Genoese merchants. More are on their way, which we expect to fall in
with. But indeed, my dearest love, we require not riches to add to our
happiness. Let us but have peace and tranquillity, and we have enough
for every earthly enjoyment whilst it pleases Heaven to bless us with
good health. Alas, poor Lady W.! how sensibly I feel for the
misfortune that has deprived her excellent husband of all prospect of
ever again enjoying comfort in this life. She was, indeed, all you
have said of her.</p>

<p>"To-morrow I depend on arriving at Lisbon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> with the hope of being
detained a few days only, and where I rely on being cheered with
letters from you. <span class="italic">A propos</span>: Miss R. is there, and will not be sorry
to hear the Leander is at last heard of, although in possession of the
enemy. She is going to England with General and Mrs. Trigge.</p>

<p>"27th October.&mdash;I had hoped before the arrival of this <span class="italic">blessed</span> day
to acquaint you with our being safe in the Tagus; but the light winds
prevented our getting round Cape St. Vincent before yesterday evening,
and it now blows so strong from the westward that there is no
possibility of getting over the bar. To-morrow, I trust, we shall be
more fortunate; or, what would prove still better, that it will blow
so strong as to compel me to bear up for the Channel, which I
certainly would do in case of a south-west gale.</p>

<p>"Sunday, two o'clock.&mdash;I now congratulate you on our safe arrival in
the Tagus, in the midst of very boisterous weather; but, thanks to
Divine Providence! without an accident to any of the ships; I have but
once more to weigh anchor, and then I trust in its mercy to bring me
to the haven where I would be, and to find all my precious treasures
in complete possession of health and happiness.</p>

<p>"A packet arrived this morning with Commissioner Coffin. The only
letter I have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> so fortunate as to receive is one from Mr. Le M.
dated the day Captain Capel arrived. What would I not give for one of
as late date from you! Another is soon expected, this packet having
had nearly three weeks' passage."</p>

<p>The extract of the following letter from Sir James to the
commander-in-chief continues this narrative:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Orion, Tagus, 1st November, 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint your lordship of the safe arrival in the Tagus of
this ship and the Theseus, with five of the prize-ships lately taken in his
Majesty's service.</p>

<p>His grace the Duc d'Havr&eacute; embarks on board this ship on Monday next; and the
Marquis de Mortemart having solicited a passage to England, I have consented to
receive him on condition of his being considered in the suite of the duke.
Captain Tyler also takes his passage in the Orion. I should have been happy to
have made the like offer to General Trigge, but it was not possible to
accommodate him and the ladies of his family without considerable inconvenience
to the Duc d'Havr&eacute;. His grace is a nobleman of the first distinction and
consideration, and he expresses himself very sensible of your lordship's
attention in providing for him so good a conveyance.</p>

<p>I beg to offer my most sincere and fervent wishes for health and every happiness
to attend your lordship; and, with my unfeigned thanks for all your lordship's
favour,</p>

<p class="left75">I remain, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Sir James, having now fulfilled the anxious charge entrusted to him,
and, with great professional skill and unremitting vigilance, brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the prizes in safety to Lisbon, is at length setting sail for England:
and who will not share the feelings of the husband and the father, on
approaching his home after so long an absence! The following extracts
from his letters will convey some impression of what those feelings
were.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Lisbon, Nov. 3rd, 1798.</p>

<p>I am now rejoicing in the hope of being in England nearly as soon as this letter
can reach you. I propose to sail from this place the beginning of next week, and
I trust my arrival will shortly follow. Let me find a letter from you at
Portsmouth. I depend on your being ready to set off as soon as you hear the
Orion is there. The post will arrive sufficiently early to allow of your leaving
Bath the same day. I may possibly be able to meet you on the road, as I shall
have had time to despatch Monsieur le Duc d'Havr&eacute; (who is a very polite
Frenchman) and to make arrangements against our return. I think it right to
mention that unless the wind admits the ships getting over the Bar of Lisbon, I
may be detained. But I hope for a quick passage.</p></div>

<p>"Sunday, November 25th, Spithead.&mdash;I wrote to you, this morning, from
St. Helens. The happy moment is at length arrived when I can despatch
a letter from Spithead. Yours of yesterday is in my hand. To-morrow
you will be setting off; but I fear the service will prevent our
meeting till the day after.</p>

<p>"I have despatched Dumaresq to Newport for our dear boy; and I depend
on seeing him to-night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> <span class="italic">Le Duc est empress&eacute; de le voir.</span> I hope to
get the party on shore, <span class="italic">de bonne heure</span>, to-morrow: but we are still
in quarantine whilst I am making these arrangements.</p>

<p>"Tuesday morning.&mdash;Great is my disappointment at being kept thus long
in quarantine: it is a cruel <span class="italic">contre temps</span>, and the more so from its
being unforeseen. What adds to my disappointment is, that I am at a
loss to know if our <span class="italic">pratique</span> has been received by this day's post,
the weather having prevented all communication with the shore. It will
rejoice you to learn that our beloved boy has been with me since ten,
yesterday morning, and that I find him all you have described. I
expect to hear every moment of your arrival at the Fountain. Mr.
Maxwell writes there is no doubt of our being released to-morrow.</p>

<p>"One o'clock.&mdash;If our <span class="italic">pratique</span> is not received by this post, request
Sir Peter to set the telegraph at work, now that the weather has
cleared up. 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Your letter has this instant reached me. The
tidings of your arrival have relieved my mind from great inquietude.
The messenger has orders to wait your commands until after the post
hour to-morrow; and if we are not then admitted to the privileges of
<span class="italic">Christian charity</span> after our <span class="italic">Egyptian bondage</span>, we must <span class="italic">endeavour</span>
to submit to our fate. James is by my side, and glows with
thankfulness at being so soon likely to embrace his beloved mamma. He
has indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> been a real comfort to me under this sad contrariety of
events. I have placed Monsieur Le Duc, and the rest of the party, at
cards, to send these lines in time <span class="italic">pour ton r&eacute;veil demain. Encore
adieu, ma tr&egrave;s ch&egrave;re</span>! Write every hour of the day, and send your
letters to Mr. Maxwell.</p>

<p>"Wednesday morning.&mdash;Grieved as I am to be a prisoner still another
day, there is consolation in the <span class="italic">certainty</span> of our being released
to-morrow. Ardently as I aspire for the moment of our meeting, I must
delay going on shore until after the performance of divine service in
this ship:<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and I know this arrangement will have your full
concurrence. Your note is just received: how well have you anticipated
my thoughts, and met my wishes even before they were expressed. Please
God, to-morrow we shall be compensated for a separation of two long
years; and on a day in which none can have greater mercies to
commemorate than ourselves.</p>

<p>"Wednesday evening.&mdash;I have just ascertained that the Duke and the Marquis
do not proceed to town before Friday; therefore expect to receive them at
dinner, and desire Mrs. Fielding to prepare for eighteen or twenty guests."</p>

<p>Sir James remained at Portsmouth, until the 15th December, when he
sailed for Plymouth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> at which place he arrived on the 22nd: and on
the 6th of January 1799 the Orion was paid off, when Sir James went to
Bath, where he was once more free and happy in the bosom of his
family.</p>

<p>Sir James had cherished the hope that he was to be permitted to enjoy
the blessings of domestic life, at least for a few months; but even in
the most perfect state of happiness which can be well imagined, he
always held his duty to his King and country, (next to the duty he
owed to his Creator,) to be paramount to every other consideration;
and, feeling himself bound, after a short period of relaxation, to
offer his services, he wrote the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Bath, 15th January 1799.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>As you were pleased to intimate your intention of being at Bath when I last had
the honour of seeing you, I delayed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>writing until this time. I am extremely
happy to find that Lady Spencer's improved state of health has rendered the
journey unnecessary.</p>

<p>Two days after my arrival I received a letter from Admiral Young, proposing to
me (in the absence of your lordship) a large seventy-four, which I declined
accepting, as you had done me the honour to offer me the C&aelig;sar, on a certain
expected event taking place. I hope you will forgive me for entreating that as
many of the Orion's ship's company may be reserved for me as the service will
admit. Having experienced their uniform good conduct for so many years, I am
most solicitous to have them with me in another ship.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i2">With the highest respect,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your lordship's most obedient and humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To the Right Honourable Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>To the above, Sir James received the following answer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 18th January 1799.</p>
<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Lady Spencer's journey to Bath is only deferred, I fear; as it will probably be
necessary for her to go there soon.</p>

<p>The proposal made to you by Admiral Young was only intended as a temporary
measure, in case you had no objection to be employed in the interval before you
could have a permanent appointment. Whenever the period shall come at which I
can propose such an appointment to you, I shall avail myself of it with
pleasure. With respect to reserving your ship's company, that practice is
attended with so much inconvenience to the public service, that it has of late
been necessarily discontinued. Although there is no one in whose favour I should
be more disposed to relax <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>than to you, I fear it will be impossible for me to
do so in this particular. I am, dear sir,</p>

<p class="left60">Your very obedient and humble servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Spencer.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The 14th of February, being the anniversary of the glorious victory
obtained over the Spanish fleet, was selected for a promotion of
flag-officers; and on this occasion his Majesty was pleased to confer
on Sir James Saumarez one of the colonelcies of Marines as a reward
for his many and meritorious services. Earl Spencer availed himself of
the opportunity to appoint him to the C&aelig;sar, of 84 guns, one of the
finest, but hitherto most unfortunate, ships in the British navy. Sir
James hoisted his pendant on the 26th of February, and had the
satisfaction to have several of his officers and crew removed from the
Orion to the C&aelig;sar, in Hamoaze, where her fitting out went on with
considerable rapidity. On the 19th of March she proceeded to Cawsand
Bay, where, on the 30th, she rode out a heavy gale of wind from the
S.E.</p>

<p>On the following day, in company with the Magnificent and Impetueux,
she sailed for the Channel fleet, commanded by Admiral Berkeley, which
she joined off Brest the 3rd April. On the 16th, Lord Bridport arrived
from Portsmouth with five sail more, increasing the fleet to fifteen
sail of the line. Another heavy gale was experienced on the 20th, but
no damage was sustained.</p>

<p>On the 25th, looking into Brest Harbour, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> were surprised to see
the French fleet, consisting of twenty-five sail, partly in Camaret
Bay, and under way in Brest Water. The fleet stood off Ushant; the
wind came to the S.E. with hazy weather, and on the same night they
escaped.</p>

<p>Sir James writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"April 27th.&mdash;Yesterday at noon, it blowing very strong from the
northward, with foggy weather, the signal was made that the enemy was
under sail. A general chase soon followed; but, I am sorry to say,
they eluded our pursuit under cover of the thick weather, keeping
close to their shore, by the passage du Raz. The cruise has now taken
quite a different turn to what I expected; and it gives me great
spirits to find we are likely to render to our country some service.</p>

<p>"1st of May.&mdash;My fervent vows were very early offered, my best love,
for Heaven's choicest blessings to attend you, with many, many returns
of your natal day. The fatted calf was intended to have been killed
for the f&ecirc;te; but the bustle caused by the French fleet occasioned its
being neglected. Your health, however, will be drunk in a bumper of my
best wine. I have a letter from the Duc d'Havr&eacute;, dated Edinburgh,
where he was on a visit to Monsieur.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> He was going to embark for
the continent. <span class="italic">Mille complimens de sa part pour miladi</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>
<p>"May 5th.&mdash;We have had, the last three days, a strong S.E. gale,
which has brought us off Ireland. I hope to-morrow we shall fall in
with ships from Plymouth, and that I shall have the satisfaction of
receiving letters from you,&mdash;the greatest I can possibly enjoy at this
time, except that of beating the French fleet.</p>

<p>"May 8th.&mdash;Off Cape Clear.&mdash;Captain Durham hailed me: he says the
French fleet were seen a week ago, steering to the southward. These
are trying times for those who feel as we do the importance of events,
which involve and may decide the fate of nations.</p>

<p>"May 17th.&mdash;Sir Alan Gardner has joined us this morning with a
reinforcement. We are still without any certain intelligence of the
enemy; a few days must determine. I only wish we could soon, very soon
meet them, to put a stop to our perplexity and impatience.</p>

<p>"Friday evening, 24th May.&mdash;We are just anchored in Bantry Bay. I fear
my conjectures of the enemy being gone to Portugal, or the
Mediterranean, and not being destined for this country, are too surely
founded.</p>

<p>"I have this instant received your letter of the 4th, by which,
though, as yet, very hastily perused, I learn you are at Teignmouth. I
am sorry to see that you have already taken alarm at the reports which
are circulated respecting us: follow the example of Lady Howe, who
neither reads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> newspapers, nor listens to rumours. I know not who are
most to blame, those who invent them, or you who believe them.</p>

<p>"26th.&mdash;We continue without any certain accounts respecting the
destination of the French armament. Admiral Collingwood arrived this
morning, and hoists his flag in the Triumph. He will take a strong
detachment with him for the Mediterranean. It is not yet known what
ships are to go: but I have been on board Lord Bridport; and I do not
hear the C&aelig;sar is to be one of them; which, I suppose, will <span class="italic">please</span>
you: <span class="italic">in other respects</span>, there is no doubt that the Mediterranean
station is far preferable to the Channel service. Your wish that we
should carry away a mast was nearly gratified, the Achille and the
C&aelig;sar having been on board each other in coming into this bay; the
principal damage was, however, sustained by the former;
notwithstanding which, she will not be obliged to return into port;
therefore, form no such wishes, but show yourself a true patriot, and
let the good of the country be the principal wish of your heart. The
escape of the French fleet, was, I dare say, consonant to these
feminine feelings, and see what a dilemma it has thrown us into.</p>

<p>"31st May.&mdash;Off Cape Clear.&mdash;I see Lord Bridport very frequently, who
always inquires most kindly after you. His lordship, it may be
believed, is not very well satisfied with the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> state of
affairs. We must hope that future good will result from apparent evil;
but it must ever be regretted that the French fleet escaped from
Brest, without being brought to action. I think it probable Sir Alan
Gardner will have the command of a strong detachment, and proceed off
Cape Finisterre; but what ships are to be attached to him will not be
known until the separation takes place. Should the French fleet be
gone up the Mediterranean, they will proceed on that station; in which
case I hope the C&aelig;sar will be one of Sir Alan's squadron. I am well
provided for a long cruise. When I shall hear from you, Heaven alone
knows! but I am endued with patience, after all our trials. The
<span class="italic">&eacute;loge</span> of Mr. Morgan, on our dear boy, is a great satisfaction to me,
and no less so at knowing him to be where his morals will be attended
to, equally with the other branches of his education.</p>

<p>"June 9th.&mdash;My last will have led you to expect my being detached with
Sir A. Gardner. We separated from Lord Bridport, Saturday, with
sixteen sail of the line; and we are already the distance of Lisbon,
with a fine breeze, steering for the Mediterranean. I almost fear we
shall be too late, notwithstanding the expedition we are using. I fell
in with a Dane, from whom I learned the French fleet had passed the
Straits, and Lord St. Vincent after them.</p>

<p>"Sunday 10th.&mdash;In going down with the information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> to the Admiral, we
had the misfortune to carry away our fore-top-mast. I was not a little
surprised to find Sir Alan with only the Magnificent and Russell, Sir
Charles Cotton having been detached to the Mediterranean; thus I fear
we shall be deprived sharing in the victory we hoped to obtain over
the enemy's fleet. Our small squadron is returning towards Lisbon,
instead of gaining the medals we made sure of.</p>

<p>"14th.&mdash;Off Lisbon. We are anxiously waiting here for intelligence.
The Admiral surprised me with the information that the object of our
coming to Lisbon was to take away our prizes. He has ordered me in to
accelerate their joining him."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Sir Alexander Ball, in a letter to Sir James, dated off Malta, 27th
April 1799, writes: "Be assured that your appointment to the Marines
and the command of the C&aelig;sar, which are given to you as a mark of the
high estimation in which you are regarded by the Admiralty and the
public, has given me more joy than I should have received from the
appointment of any other person on the list, because I have had the
satisfaction of witnessing your bravery, zeal, and ardour in the
service. I am much pleased with your plan of the sword."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>The Commander-in-chief, supposing the destination of the French
expedition to be Ireland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> proceeded at once to Bantry Bay, where the
fleet remained until the end of May; while the enemy passed the
Straits of Gibraltar unmolested, having been on that occasion favoured
by a gale of wind, which prevented the fleet under Lord Keith (though
certainly very inferior) from bringing them to action. The French and
Spanish fleets returned to Brest, unobserved, on the 21st of June.</p>

<p>In the mean time a part of Lord Bridport's fleet, in which was the
C&aelig;sar, proceeded under command of Sir Alan Gardner to the Tagus, which
it left on the 18th; and, cruising back, returned to Cawsand Bay on
the 13th July. As the enemy showed no disposition to put to sea again,
the C&aelig;sar, and the rest of the fleet, remained quietly at Cawsand Bay,
and subsequently at Torbay till the 2nd September, when they again
sailed. In the course of the three ensuing months it put back three
times; and finally, on the 8th of December 1799, when the Admiralty,
being desirous of ascertaining whether Torbay was a safe anchorage for
the fleet during the winter months, ordered the C&aelig;sar to continue on
that station for the trial, and at the same time placed the London, of
98 guns, under the orders of Sir James. The tempestuous weather which
prevailed during the rest of the month, and throughout January,
afforded several occasions to determine the point. The London, during
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> heavy gale, parted her cables, and was with great difficulty
preserved from going on shore, which left no doubt that it was an
insecure and unfit post to shelter a fleet.</p>

<p>On the 17th March 1800, Lord Bridport took command of the fleet, which
was soon after increased to twenty-five sail of the line; but nothing
remarkable occurred till the 18th of May, when a dreadful gale
occasioned much damage to many of the ships. The wind was at first
S.W. and blew with great violence, when it suddenly checked to the
N.W., before the S.W. sea had time to subside: most of the fleet wore.
The Lady Jane, Trompeuse, and Railleur foundered: the Montague lost
all her masts, and several others met with damage. It appears by the
log of the C&aelig;sar that she continued for some time on the same tack,
which may account for her having sustained little injury, although it
mentions that she shipped several heavy seas. So tremendous was the
rolling of the ship, that her lower yard-arms were at one time under
water, while the carpenters stood by with their axes, to cut the masts
away, if she had not righted. She did not bear up for Torbay with the
rest of the fleet, but followed two days after, and, having
replenished her water and provisions, resumed her station, from whence
Sir James wrote a letter to Lady Saumarez, of which the following is
an extract:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">"C&aelig;sar, 26th June, 1800.</p></div>

<p>"Of the enemy in this neighbourhood we know nothing, except of their
inactivity. I hope they do not mean to leave so fine a fleet, as we
have here, useless all the summer. Fear not my complying with your
injunctions. I shall more than ever strive against <span class="italic">ennui</span>,&mdash;my
greatest enemy, I believe, whilst in this inactive state. I read when
I can, but anxiety to hear from you, and to have accounts of our
darling children, has its share in withdrawing my attention and fixing
it on more interesting subjects. Of one thing, however, be assured,
that with respect to the ship and all thereto belonging, I am as well
situated as possible. I enjoy the satisfaction of having a very quiet
and well-disposed ship's company, who are kept orderly, and, I flatter
myself, well regulated, without exercising severity or rigour. The
officers continue as I wish them. Captain Maxwell, who joined some
time ago, is an active, diligent officer in his corps; and Mr.
Packwood, as well as Mr. Holliday, our new chaplain, are very good men
in their respective stations.</p>

<p>"Although I find amusement in books, believe me your letters form my
sole delight, and tend more to lighten the time than all the volumes
in Hoxland's library."</p>

<p>Sir James, after another cruise, returned on the 24th of July, to
prepare for a service of more responsibility and importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>The French had now a large fleet at Brest, which appeared to be in a
state of great forwardness; and, as they had before eluded the
vigilance of the blockading ships, it was necessary to place a strong
squadron near the Black Rocks to watch their motions, and to give the
command of this advanced detachment to an officer of skill,
experience, and intrepidity. Earl St. Vincent, who was now
commander-in-chief of the Channel fleet, knowing how highly Sir James
Saumarez was qualified for such an important trust, gave him the
following order to take command of the in-shore squadron:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>You are hereby required and directed to proceed without a moment's loss of time,
in his Majesty's ship under your command, off the Black Rocks, where you may
expect to find his Majesty's ships named in the margin, <a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>which you are to take under your command; their
respective captains being instructed to obey your orders: and having received
from Captain Knight, of his Majesty's ship Montague, authenticated copies of all
orders and papers in his possession relative to the command of the advanced
squadron, carry the same into execution until you receive further orders.</p>

<p>You will also receive from Captain Knight a sealed secret instruction,
addressed to the officer commanding the advanced squadron off the
Black Rocks for the time being, which is on no account to be opened,
but under the circumstances thereon directed.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez, &amp;c.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Copy of Instructions to the Senior Officer of the advanced squadron
off the Black Rocks.</p>

<p>You are hereby required and directed to take under your command the
advanced squadron, composed of his Majesty's ships named on the other
side hereof, (whose captains are instructed to obey your orders,)
stationed off the Black Rocks and in the Bay of Brest, for the purpose
of watching the combined fleets in that port; adopting such measures
as you shall judge necessary for gaining every possible information of
their force, condition, and movements.</p>

<p>In the execution of this most important service, the line-of-battle
ships (composing the advanced squadron) are to be anchored during an
easterly wind in the Iroise Passage, as well to support the look-out
frigates, as to intercept a squadron of the enemy which is held in
constant readiness to slip out the very first opportunity that shall
offer; and during a westerly wind, you are not to fail in making Brest
every day, if possible, but at all events to take such precautions as
will enable you to resume your former position in the Iroise, on the
first appearance of easterly wind.</p>

<p>You are to communicate to me from time to time every intelligence you
may obtain respecting the enemy; and in case he should come out in
great force, while the squadron under my command is in this
rendezvous, you are to give me immediate notice thereof, and also the
officers commanding the detachments off the Passage Du Raz, Isle
Grois, and in Quiberon Bay; but, in the event of my being compelled by
tempestuous weather to take shelter in Torbay, and of the enemy
seizing that opportunity of putting to sea, you are to give me
information thereof by every means in your power: taking under your
command <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>the detachments off the Passage Du Raz, Isle Grois, and in
Quiberon Bay, together with the ships named in the margin,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which
are directed to keep as near the Black Rocks as possible, under the
orders of Captain Sutton, for the support of your ships; and to hang
upon and use your utmost endeavours to harass the enemy's rear until
the approach of this squadron, which, you may be assured, will be in
pursuit.</p>

<p>Sir James now proceeded, in the C&aelig;sar, to assume the important command
off the Black Rocks, which had deservedly obtained the name of New
Siberia, as being the least desirable of stations for a ship-of-war.
It is, indeed, scarcely possible to describe any situation more
miserable; for, besides being at the very entrance of a port
containing twenty-five sail of the line ready for sea, which might
slip out and attack the squadron of six, the ships are two-thirds
surrounded with rocks and dangers, which afford no shelter; while they
are open to the S.W. winds. They have often great difficulty in
working out, sometimes against the tide as well as against the wind;
and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> in reconnoitring, they are exposed to the fire of the enemy on
each side of Brest Water.</p>

<p>The following extracts of private letters written by Sir James to Lady
Saumarez, will be found interesting, as they convey the best idea of
his situation.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off the Black Rocks, Sunday evening, 2d Sept. 1800.</p>

<p><span class="italic">On dit</span>, but I do not believe it, that the French fleet is to be ordered out by
the First Consul, at all risks. We may therefore expect to make <span class="italic">minced meat</span> of
them with our seventeen three-deckers. We remain in sight of the enemy
unmolested by them. To-day I had the colours hoisted, to show them Sunday was
not expunged from <span class="italic">our</span> calendar; and divine service was performed on board.</p>

<p>Our boats have occasionally landed on some small islands near this. Captain
Buller purchased two nice little cows, one of which he has spared me: it is so
tame, the children could play with it. It supplies me with milk, and cost me
only three guineas.</p>

<p>The Guernsey traders continue with the squadron; but, on account of the spirits
they sell to the ships, I wish them further off. I have been obliged to be harsh
with them, from this circumstance; and I expect they will give a very bad report
of their countryman when they return to the island.</p>
<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off the Black Rocks, Sept. 12th 1800.</p>

<p> Sir Henry Harvey has joined the fleet, which makes up the complement of flags;
and it remains to be proved if the Earl has influence to effect what he so
strenuously aims at respecting the promotion. I form very sanguine hopes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>that
peace will shortly extend its blessed influence over these countries; and that I
shall have the satisfaction to enjoy, without interruption, the sweets of
domestic comfort. I certainly shall avail myself of the earliest respite the
service will enable me to pass in the island; and I think I may have that
opportunity this winter; for if the war should be continued, there is no doubt
that a promotion would give me, at least, six weeks interval from duty; at any
rate, I see no reason for the future affording you anxiety, as whether there, or
in England, I depend on our passing a considerable portion of the winter
together. I hope Master Saumarez knows his alpha, beta, &amp;c. by heart. When
convenient to the young gentleman, I shall be glad that he will take the trouble
to transcribe it for me to Omega, as I have no Greek grammar by me. I can
readily believe the difficulty that attends fixing the little ladies to the
French grammar, whose particularly quick and lively temper is not much suited to
so tedious a process. I think, notwithstanding, it is the best method,
especially as the same grammatical rules are adapted to any language, which they
will find useful hereafter. Dancing, no doubt, has more attractions. I trust
they have quite got rid of their colds: their papa has also had a very severe
one, and kept his cabin for two days; but he is now perfectly recovered.</p>

<p>September 18th. I admire N., with his comments on Colchester. When you next
write, recommend him to try the Black Rocks in a thick fog, and no chance of
letters from England: he will find even Norman Cross preferable. I, however,
believe I have done with that anchorage for some time, as the wind is set in to
the westward; and I shall now cruise to prevent vessels going into Brest.</p>

<p>I am happy to say I am perfectly well. I trust my <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>nerves will prove equal to
the task; as I have before often told you, they generally strengthen with
difficulties.</p>

<p>I mean to make this cruise long enough to entitle me to a relief, therefore do
not expect me in port as long as I can keep the sea.</p></div>

<p>Sir James immediately gave such orders and regulations as would best
guard against, or overcome, the difficulties inseparable from such a
service; and, with the prospect of a long winter before him, he sent
these regulations, and a list of the rendezvous appointed by him, to
the commander-in-chief, whose letter to Sir James, in answer, is
expressive of the high opinion he entertained of him.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Ville de Paris, off Ushant, 15th Sept. 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Nothing can be more appropriate than the different rendezvous you have sent me a
copy of; your change of position must fluctuate according to the sudden changes
of the weather, which are to be looked for soon. I repose such unbounded
confidence in your zeal and judgment that <span class="italic">I sleep as soundly as if I had the key
of Brest in my possession</span>.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Strachan and Captain Buller, in the Captain and Edgar, will relieve
two of the ships which last joined you as soon as they return to this
rendezvous, and the Canada will relieve the third. As I have applied for Captain
Foley's leave of absence on very important private business, I wish the Elephant
to be the first sent to me. I am, sir,</p>

<p class="left60">Your most obedient humble servant,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p><p>It was supposed that the Brest fleet would take advantage of the
equinoctial gales, which were now approaching, and slip out as before,
when the in-shore squadron was blown off, or compelled to bear up for
Torbay; but Sir James had determined on frustrating their attempt. On
the 23rd a heavy gale came on, which, in former instances, would have
obliged the in-shore squadron to abandon the post; but, instead of
bearing up for Torbay when no longer able to maintain his position,
Sir James steered for Douvarnenez Bay, where he anchored with the
whole squadron, just out of range of the enemy's mortar batteries,
which soon tried their shells, but without effect.</p>

<p>Here his squadron struck top-masts and lower yards, and rode out all
the equinoctial gales, actually in the enemy's harbour, within a few
miles of their whole fleet of four times his force, and in perfect
safety! The gale had been very severe; and although Earl St. Vincent,
who was obliged to run with his fleet for Torbay, had no fears for the
safety of the in-shore squadron, relying as he did on the experience
and skill of Sir James, yet the Admiralty were in a considerable state
of alarm until the following account of his proceedings was received:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THE RIGHT HON. EARL SPENCER.</p>
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Douvarnenez Bay, 26th Sept. 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>On the supposition that the fleet may have been driven from their station by the
late tempestuous weather, and as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>some anxiety may be excited for the safety of
this squadron, I take the opportunity by the Marlborough to inform your lordship
of my having anchored in this bay last Tuesday evening, with the ships under my
command, where we have ridden the gale out in perfect safety, together with the
Montague and Naiad, which ships anchored here on Wednesday.</p>

<p>This is a most spacious bay, and may be considered safe anchorage in any
weather: it lies about four leagues to the southward of Brest; from which port
it is only separated about five miles by land, over a mountainous and hilly
country. As the same winds that enable the enemy's fleet to put to sea, also
lead out of this bay, we can always be in time for them; and this appears the
most favourable position to prevent their coasting convoys coming from the
southern ports. The enemy has endeavoured to annoy the squadron with shells, but
at too great a distance to reach any of the ships, and the whole fleet may lie
in perfect safety from any of the batteries.</p>

<p>I purpose to remain here until the weather becomes more moderate, to enable me
to resume the station off the Black Rocks. In the mean time, ships will
occasionally be detached to watch the motions of the enemy in Brest Water. I
have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>In answer to this, Sir James received the following letter from Earl
Spencer, then First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 30th Sept. 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 26th, dated from Douvarnenez
Bay, and was much pleased to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>find that you had got hold of that anchorage, as I
felt very uneasy at your absence during the late gales. I should rather doubt
whether that bay could be capacious enough for a large fleet to anchor in
without danger from the batteries; but I have always hoped that some of our
small squadron might avail themselves of that resource on such an occasion as
that which has presented itself to you; and I have no doubt that the doing so
will much assist the occupation of our fleet off Brest.</p>

<p class="left60">Believe me, dear sir,<br />
<span class="i2">Your very faithful humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Spencer.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>Sir James, at the same time, wrote to Earl St. Vincent by the
Marlborough, giving his lordship an account of his proceedings, which
could not but be highly satisfactory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Douvarnenez Bay, 26th September 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>The weather not having admitted the stores and provisions to be taken out of the
Marlborough whilst under sail, I bore up for this anchorage with the squadron;
and early Wednesday morning the boats were all employed in conveying the water
and provisions to the squadron: but it having continued to blow excessively hard
from that time, it was not until this morning we have been enabled to accomplish
this service.</p>

<p>The Montague and Naiad anchored in the bay Wednesday morning, and are now under
sail. It has blown a very severe gale of wind at north-west the last two days,
and we have saved considerable wear and tear to all the ships by having taken
this anchorage in good time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>I propose to remain here during the continuation of westerly winds, or until the
weather enables me to resume the station off the Black Rocks; detaching ships
occasionally to watch the enemy's motions.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be<br />
<span class="i2">Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>The Right Honourable the Earl of St. Vincent, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The following is an extract of a letter which Sir James wrote to Lady
Saumarez, and sent by the same opportunity. It will be found to give
an accurate description of the important anchorage of which he was the
first who was so daring as to take advantage in stormy weather, with
the squadron under his command.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Douvarnenez Bay, Sept. 24th, 1800.</p>

<p>We anchored at eleven last night, and this morning found ourselves in one of the
finest bays I have ever seen. It is far more spacious than Torbay, and much more
enclosed; consequently more secure against all winds. It is the same distance
from Brest by sea as Dartmouth is from Torbay; and by land the same as from
Brixham, not being more than five miles across, over a hilly country;
substituting the Bec de Ch&egrave;vre for the Berry Head, and it exactly forms the
counter part to Torbay. It abounds with the finest fish, of which we shall
profit.</p>

<p>As it is not possible for the ships to sail from Brest but with an easterly
wind, which blows directly out of this bay, we can always be beforehand with
them.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;It has continued to blow hard since we entered this bay, and it has
now risen to a severe storm. I wish <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>you knew how well sheltered we are in this
famous anchorage. Captain Pierrepont has been with me since yesterday: he has
been near fourteen weeks at sea, and, as you may suppose, very tired. I am
better satisfied with my situation than since I have been in the Channel fleet,
and find it far preferable to being attached to it.</p>

<p class="right">Monday, 29th Sept.</p>

<p>I trust my letter by the Marlborough has reached you this morning, which will
have set your mind at ease as to our safety after the gales we encountered last
week. I wrote to you yesterday, but too hastily to express, as I wished, the
happiness I derived from having just received your letters of the 15th and 19th.
They had been too long and too anxiously looked for not to receive the most
cordial and heartfelt welcome. I am in hourly expectation of seeing the fleet,
the letters from the Earl acquainting me with his intention of putting to sea
the moment the weather moderated. The Superb, with Centaur and Warrior, hove in
sight this afternoon,&mdash;the only ships I have seen since last Tuesday, when
I went into Douvarnenez Bay; and I have the satisfaction to reflect that,
notwithstanding the tempestuous weather, this squadron has been enabled to keep
its station, although all the other detachments have been driven from theirs.
Now that your letter gives me reason to believe you entertain serious thoughts
of going to Guernsey, like your father I lose my courage at the prospect of it.
I sincerely wish I had never suggested the idea, which I was induced to do from
the hope of the war being over, and that you would pass the winter more
comfortably than in England during the dreary months. I am now become a very
coward on the subject, and leave it to you to determine as you think best; at
the same time assuring you that I shall endeavour <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>to be reconciled to whatever
plan is adopted which is most likely to conduce to your comfort. Your account of
our dear girls gives me the most heartfelt satisfaction, and of the increasing
strength of the sweet dove in particular, whom I truly long to behold,&mdash;a
happiness I still hope to enjoy ere many weeks are elapsed. I shall expect a
letter from the dear boy by the next opportunity from Plymouth.</p></div>

<p>The next letter to the Earl of St. Vincent gives an account of the
further proceedings of his squadron, and the situation of the enemy's
fleet in Brest, which proves how successful his endeavours had been in
preventing its meditated escape.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off the Black Rocks, 28th September 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>Soon after I despatched my letter by the Marlborough, dated from Douvarnenez
Bay, the wind having shifted to the northward, I got under sail with the
squadron; but in the evening it came to the south-west, with thick weather: I
returned to the anchorage, as did Captain Knight, with the Montague and Naiad.</p>

<p>It continued to blow very strong till yesterday noon, when the wind suddenly
shifted to N. and N. by E. I immediately got under sail, and stood out of the
bay; the Pomp&eacute;e leaving a bower-anchor, her cable having parted in endeavouring
to weigh it. From the report of several signal-guns fired in Brest soon after
the sudden change of wind, I have no doubt of the preparatory movements of the
enemy to put to sea, had the wind continued favourable for them; and I carried a
press of sail during the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>night, in order to be off St. Matthew's Point early
this morning to watch their motions.</p>

<p>I had a full view of the enemy's fleet, and counted twenty-two sail with their
top-gallant-masts struck, but apparently ready for sea. Having made the signal
to the Meg&aelig;ra to reconnoitre, I beg to refer your lordship to Captain Hill for a
more particular report of their state and numbers.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be, my lord,<br />
<span class="i2">Your lordship's obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>The Right Honourable the Earl of St. Vincent, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>His Majesty's ship Montague, with the Naiad, and Suwarrow schooner, went through
the bay yesterday evening.</p>

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Ville de Paris, Torbay, 4th October, 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your several letters of the 25th, 26th,
28th ultimo, and 1st instant, detailing your proceedings with his Majesty's
ships under your orders; the whole of which I very much approve, particularly
the taking under your command Captains Sutton and King, with the ships and
vessels attached to them: and you will herewith receive orders to their
respective captains and commanders to put themselves under your command, and
obey your orders for their future proceedings in the important duty of watching
the combined fleets.</p>

<p class="left60">I am, sir, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>By this bold and unexpected step, (which the French have since
characterised as a piece of <span class="italic">impudence</span>,) Sir James completely
frustrated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> meditated escape of the combined fleets, which were
now thirty-two in number, seven of which were three-deckers. He had,
moreover, the honour of being the first to defy the enemy in his own
anchorage, proving at the same time that it would not be so easy as
formerly to elude the vigilance of the advanced squadron.</p>

<p>The weather having moderated after the second return to Douvarnenez
Bay, the squadron resumed the anchorage near the Black Rocks, daily
reconnoitring the enemy, destroying several small vessels which
attempted to get in, and keeping under sail when the wind was
westerly. In continuation to Lady Saumarez he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Oct. 4th 1800.</p>

<p>The anxiety inseparable from this cruise is very considerably alleviated from
knowing the fleet is in port, which must prove of the greatest benefit both to
officers and men, and to the service in general. I find the rumours of peace are
vanished, and that war is determined upon. I trust events will be favourable to
this country. There is no doubt the French are much distressed for provisions in
the neighbourhood of Brest, and that discontent prevails among their troops, who
are ill-paid, ill-fed, and badly clothed. It is horrid to see the leading men of
all nations so infatuated for war, at a time peace is so much to be desired for
the sake of humanity.</p>

<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Bay of Brest, 18th Oct.</p>

<p>The delightful weather we have enjoyed this last week has enabled me to remain
at anchor off the Black Rocks. They have lost their gloom from the serene
atmosphere, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>but more particularly from having had such frequent tidings from
you, as scarce a day has passed (I believe not one) without being joined by
something from the fleet. Yesterday, the Earl sent me a message that he expected
my flag to be hoisted in a very few days; and Troubridge writes to me the
promotion was to extend to Sir Edward Pellew; and,&mdash;what think
you!&mdash;that Lord St. Vincent has actually written for Captain Brenton to be
appointed my flag-captain. His lordship, in his letter, tells me that Capt.
Thornbrough is to remain in the Mars, and will relieve me here, if the measure
he has proposed is acceded to: so you may perceive I have some grounds on which
to form my hopes; but I do not wish <span class="italic">you</span> to dwell too much upon it.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;I am now <span class="italic">solus</span>. Captain Brenton, who I mentioned had been staying
with me, is gone to the Ville de Paris. I know no one I should prefer as captain
under my flag. He is a steady, sensible, good officer, and of great experience,
having served several years with admirals as a lieutenant. Captain Cook dined
with me to-day on a <span class="italic">Black Rock</span> dinner, viz. a fine piece of salmon and a nice
little <span class="italic">cochon-de-lait</span>, with <span class="italic">entrem&ecirc;ts</span>, removes, &amp;c. The salmon was sent me
with a basket of vegetables from Plymouth, I suspect from Captain Markham; the
roaster was a present from Captain Hood, who, being under sail, could not dine
with me. I mention these trifles because I know they please you. The boats
occasionally go to the small islands and procure bullocks, &amp;c.; and, as fast
as the stock is purchased, they contrive to replenish it from the
mainland,&mdash;a proof they are well satisfied with the price we pay for it,
which is fixed by themselves.</p>

<p>26th Oct.&mdash;After near a fortnight passed at what the Earl now calls the
Elysian Lake (instead of Siberia), a westerly wind compelled me to get under
sail yesterday <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>afternoon; and it was fortunate that I did so, as it has blown a
gale since that time. By the Meg&aelig;ra, which has joined me this evening, I find
the fleet is to go to Torbay; and, from what Sir Thomas Troubridge writes, I
conjecture the Earl intends to go on shore part of the winter.... While we
remained at an anchor the boats of the squadron were occasionally detached in
pursuit of the enemy's vessels. Last Monday they chased one close under the
batteries at the entrance of Brest, which has afforded me an opportunity of
making favourable mention of Mr. Lamborn and Mr. Wood, who were employed on that
service. The Earl has desired me to send the latter to him to be promoted. The
Canada, which was ordered to cover the boats, took possession of three Spaniards
belonging to the Principe de Asturias, Don Gravina's flag-ship, who were fishing
in a small boat. They are to be returned without being exchanged, agreeably to
what I suggested, and I shall send in a flag of truce the first favourable
weather. We were so comfortably anchored the last fortnight, and so agreeably
employed, that it has nearly spoilt me for the remainder of the cruise. Of the
promotion nothing further is said, and I have not heard when I am to be
released. If I am kept out much longer, and have the duty of an admiral without
my flag, I fear I shall grow <span class="italic">sulky</span> and impatient. It is not improbable Captain
Sutton may relieve me in the charge of this squadron, as I doubt Sir Edward
Pellew being yet ready. I fear the second return of the fleet will have again
set your heart palpitating, and caused you another disappointment at the C&aelig;sar
not being with it.</p>

<p>October 30th.&mdash;Yesterday I received a very civil reply to the letter I
wrote to Don Gravina, who wishes that I may live many thousand years. The French
received the officer from the Canada who was entrusted with the flag of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>truce
with great politeness. I sent Maingy from this ship as interpreter. They
remained at Camaret till the following morning. You will not be displeased to
hear that the C&aelig;sar must go into port <span class="italic">from necessity</span>, having sprung her
main-yard; but, if possible, I shall delay it three or four weeks longer,
notwithstanding my <span class="italic">threat</span> of losing patience. I shall depend on finding you at
Dartmouth.</p>

<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Nov. 1st.</p>

<p>I remain without any of your letters since the 20th, which I feel a grievous
circumstance, particularly at this time, when I am left in doubt whether you are
still at Dartmouth, or gone to Bath. This morning I experienced a severe
disappointment. The Nile cutter, whose tardy approach for four hours was
anxiously waited for, at last joined without any letters, having left Plymouth
with sealed orders. We have such blessed weather at present that it is almost
impious to be discontented; yet I cannot enjoy it while I remain so long without
hearing from you. I accuse the Earl of indifference to the comfort of those whom
it is incumbent on him to attend to. Since he has left this station there has
been scarcely a day that the wind has not been favourable for vessels to join
us. A fortnight or three weeks more and I hope my turn will come, when, if
things do not meet my expectations, I shall be tempted to take leave of the good
ship, and look out for a snug cottage to pass some time in the enjoyment of your
society. I am serious, <span class="italic">je t'assure</span>. I understand Sir Hyde Parker is to command
in the absence of the chief. <span class="italic">Cela ne me plait pas aucunement</span>; for, after having
been employed upon this important and arduous service with acknowledged credit,
I shall certainly very ill brook being hurried out of port in the usual manner
to serve with him: I therefore <span class="italic">go on shore</span> unless my views are complied with.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>I
hope to-morrow to have letters from you to acknowledge the receipt of. At
present I am much out of humour, and with too much cause to be easily reconciled
on any other terms but of hearing from you.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;Another disappointment this morning, having been joined by a lugger
which we hoped had letters, but which proves to be from another quarter. I look
for the Nimrod: if she joins us to-morrow I shall be satisfied. It has blown
strong all day, with very thick weather. I hope for better success, but I still
continue out of temper.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;The Superb, which has been in sight since daylight, is at last
joining. Imagine my impatience after a whole fortnight since the date of your
last letter. Captain Sutton, who is now with me, has not brought a single
letter. I send this by the Courageux, and have only time to say that the Edgar
is hourly expected, and possibly we may be more fortunate. A ship is in sight: I
hope it is her.</p></div>

<p>On the 9th of November the fleet experienced one of the severest gales
ever known, which did immense damage to the shipping; but, except the
loss of some storm-sails, the C&aelig;sar sustained no injury; while several
of the others lost masts and yards, obliging them to return to port.
But Sir James kept his station; indeed, during the whole fifteen weeks
he had the command, not a vessel either sailed from, or entered, the
harbour of Brest.</p>

<p>At last, seeing their escape impossible, they began to dismantle the
ships; and Sir James received the following letter from Earl St.
Vincent:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>The Impetueux took in her guns this day, and Sir Edward Pellew will receive his
orders to-morrow morning; and, if the wind favours his getting out of Hamoaze,
he will be with you in the course of the week. You will receive by him orders to
proceed to Spithead; but I shall be very glad to see you here <span class="italic">en route</span>, and I
will inform Lady Saumarez by to-morrow's post of your probable approach.</p>

<p>Lord Spencer has been fully impressed by me of the long and arduous service you
have undergone, and seems well disposed to give you the respite so justly due to
the cheerfulness with which you have conducted the most important employment of
this war. I am not in the secret when the promotion is to take effect. Private
letters from town and the newspapers are full of it, and I am morally certain it
will be out soon; for one of the ninety-gun ships, commanded by an officer very
near the head of the list of captains, is nominated for Sir Erasmus Gower's
flag, which appears conclusive.</p>

<p>Sir Hyde Parker has asked leave of absence; and, as the size of the fleet of
observation is much reduced, I conceive it will be granted.</p>

<p class="left60">Yours, most truly,<br />
<span class="i2">Torr Abbey, 2nd December, 1800.</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The following extract, which alludes to the preceding, was written by
Sir James to Lady Saumarez on the</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>29th Dec.&mdash;The Earl informs me of his intention to write to you. I perceive
he is resolved to become a favourite <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>of yours by his attention. The order for
the C&aelig;sar to anchor in Torbay for twenty-four hours, on her way to Portsmouth,
will not lessen his favour with you. After this, I suppose I cannot do less than
invite you to take a passage in the ship with your two dear little companions;
but it must be on condition that the weather is propitious to my views.</p></div>

<p>The station off the Black Rocks had hitherto been considered tenable
only by frigates during the winter; on which service three or four
were annually employed; but which, like the Channel fleet,
occasionally took refuge in Torbay. It had been, however, resolved
upon by Earl St. Vincent to form an advanced squadron of six sail of
the line; and Sir James, as we have before stated, was the officer
selected to proceed on this arduous and important undertaking. None
but professional men who have been in that anxious and perilous
service can have any idea of its difficulties. In such a situation the
commanding-officer must consider himself constantly in the scene of
action, surrounded by dangers of every description, exposed to the
violence of storms, and sailing amidst a multitude of rocks and
variable currents, in the longest and darkest nights, and often on a
lee-shore on the enemy's coast, while the whole of their fleet is
near, and ready to take advantage of any disaster, or change of wind
or circumstance that might arise in their favour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been shown that Sir James performed this duty to the
entire satisfaction of the noble Earl, and to the country. No storm
ever obliged him to leave his station, which has justly been
denominated <span class="italic">the post of honour</span>.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this chapter with more satisfaction than by
subjoining the following interesting correspondence between Sir James
and Earl Spencer, which no longer need be characterised as "secret."</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center"><span class="italic">Secret and confidential.</span></p>
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Ushant, 20th June 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>At this time, when a proper example should be set to the seamen of his Majesty's
fleet, and a due sense of religion and the practice of it kept up in the royal
navy, permit me to suggest to your lordship the propriety of a strong
recommendation from the Board of Admiralty to the commanders-in-chief on the
different stations (more particularly the Channel fleet) that they will cause
the public worship of Almighty God to be duly and regularly performed on board
the ships under their command, and that nothing but the most pressing exigency
shall prevent Divine service from being publicly read every Sunday on board the
respective ships.</p>

<p>It is from the too flagrant neglect of this most essential part of our duty that
I have been impelled to write <span class="italic">in confidence</span> to your lordship on the subject,
with the hope that proper means will be adopted to rectify it.</p>

<p>We have signals to denote that the ship's companies will have time for dinner or
breakfast; why should there not be one to signify that they will have time for
the performance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>of Divine service? Were such a signal to be made from the ship
of the commander-in-chief on Sunday morning, it would be generally followed by
all the fleet, as they would then know the Admiral's intention to give time for
that purpose.</p>

<p>I trust that your lordship will do justice to the motives that have induced me
to write on the present subject, which I have long had in contemplation, and
which I have now decided upon from the apprehensions that seem to be entertained
of disturbances among the seamen of this fleet, as I know nothing that will
contribute more to keep them in the right line of their duty than a proper
attention to religious principles, the example to which should be set them by
their officers.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be, with the greatest regard,<br />
<span class="i2">Your lordship's most faithful</span><br />
<span class="i4">and obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>The Right Hon. Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="c15"  />
<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge your letter of the 20th instant, and am much obliged to
you for the hint contained in it. You must be aware how delicate a matter it is
for me to interfere in a detail of this description. I shall not, however, fail
to make such use of the suggestion as may appear to me to come within the bounds
of propriety, and may very probably produce the desired effect.</p>

<p>I trust that the present alarm, which has been excited by several circumstances
of a suspicious nature, may prove groundless; and I feel very strongly that
nothing can more probably contribute to make it so than every precaution being
taken in time to prevent an evil, which experience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> has already proved to us, if
suffered once to begin, is so very difficult to remedy.</p>

<p class="left55">I am, dear sir,<br /></p>
<span class="i2">Your very obedient humble servant,</span><br />

<p>Admiralty, June 1800.</p></div>

<p>The C&aelig;sar arrived at Torbay on the 14th December, and on the 21st
reached Spithead, where she remained during the rest of the year
1800.</p>

<p>Sir James Saumarez is promoted to the rank of Rear-admiral.&mdash;Appointed to
command the advanced squadron.&mdash;Proceedings at the Black
Rocks.&mdash;Douvarnenez Bay.&mdash;Returns to England.&mdash;Appointed to
command a squadron on a very particular service.&mdash;His secret orders,
&amp;c. and letter of approbation.&mdash;Ready for sea.&mdash;Is created a
Baronet of the United Kingdom.</p></div>

<p>On the 1st of January 1801, a promotion of flag-officers took place,
in order, it was said, to include the name of Sir James Saumarez; and
this flattering compliment was immediately followed by a further
honour, in his being ordered forthwith to hoist his flag on board his
old ship, the C&aelig;sar; while Lieutenant Henryson, who was senior in that
ship, was promoted to the rank of commander. Sir James being ordered
to fit for the same service in which he had lately been so
successfully employed, Captain Jahleel Brenton, who had been
recommended by Earl St. Vincent, and who had been a volunteer during
the last cruise, was appointed to the C&aelig;sar as his captain.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th of January the ship came out of harbour, and having
received her guns, and her stores and provisions for six months, the
flag of Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez was hoisted on the 24th; and
on the 25th of February he sailed to resume the command of the
in-shore squadron off Brest, but joined the Channel fleet at Torbay on
the way thither. On the 7th March he arrived off the Black Rocks,
where he relieved Admiral Thornbrough, and soon afterwards
reconnoitred the harbour of Brest. On the 20th, the severe equinoctial
gale forced the squadron into Douvarnenez Bay, where the ships
anchored in eighteen fathoms, just out of reach of the enemy's shot.
Here they remained, as much at their ease in the enemy's harbour as
they would have been at Spithead, and were never molested. On the 25th
March, after two attempts to work out of the bay, the squadron resumed
their station at the Black Rocks.</p>

<p>The following is extracted from a letter from one of the officers of
the C&aelig;sar, dated 26th March:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Our advanced squadron of the Channel fleet, commanded by Sir James Saumarez,
never quitted the French coast during the late stormy weather. We anchored
during the late violent gales in Douvarnenez Bay, which is, in my opinion, one
of the finest in the universe. It is sheltered from every wind but those from W.
1/2 N. to W. 1/2 S.; and even that opening is protected by a reef of rocks.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>Although the height of the gale was in the worst direction it could have been,
yet, having no very considerable sea, we rode it out remarkably well. We lay,
much to the disappointment of the enemy, just out of gun-shot of the forts. They
favoured us, however, with some shells. We found, upon our re-appearance off
Brest, that six Spaniards had equiped themselves, in addition to six Frenchmen,
probably with a design to attack us.</p></div>

<p>The Government having been relieved from their anxiety for the safety
of the in-shore squadron by a despatch from Sir James, Earl St.
Vincent, who was now First Lord of the Admiralty, wrote to him the
following letter of approbation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 1st April 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>The manner in which you have conducted the advanced squadron calls upon me to
repeat my admiration of it. Your taking the anchorage in Douvarnenez Bay during
the late equinoctial gales has been of the utmost importance, and prevented the
crippling of one or more of your squadron. I heartily hope you continue in good
health, for which and every other blessing you have the fervent wishes of</p>

<p class="left55">Your very sincere and obedient servant,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>To R. A. Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>During the whole of this month, Sir James kept his squadron generally
within three or four miles of the entrance of Brest, from which it was
never further than as many leagues. In this situation, and by
frequently reconnoitring in his own ship, he was enabled to watch the
preparations of the enemy, and to frustrate their designs to attack
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
his squadron with a superior force; while he so completely blockaded
their port that, as when he formerly commanded, no square-rigged
vessel ever entered it, thereby preventing the necessary supplies of
stores and provisions from reaching the dep&ocirc;t of their navy. Nor did a
single vessel escape the unwearied vigilance and perseverance of the
advanced squadron during the whole time it was under his command.</p>

<p>Early in May, letters reached him from Guernsey, intimating the great
apprehension his countrymen were under of invasion by the enemy; when
he wrote to Sir Thomas Troubridge, then one of the Lords of the
Admiralty, who sent the following answer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 17th May 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir James,</p>

<p>Many thanks for your kind letter of the 6th instant. I am sorry our <span class="italic">French
friends</span> do not come out, that you may teach them <span class="italic">English</span>. The Gazette <a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
will show you that our soldiers are getting into the habits of
fighting.</p>

<p>We heard of the miscreants' intentions on the islands; and I have sent
over several gun-brigs, gun-barges, frigates, sloops, &amp;c. and a few
additional troops. There are 5,000 regulars at Jersey, and some more
going soon, so that I think they have little chance of success if they
make the attempt; but it appears to me that the different powers
cannot look on without interfering, and stopping the progress of the
villains. In short, I hope to see them soon weighed down in a
congress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord St. Vincent's cough is better, and the warm weather will
re-establish him. I beg you to give my best compliments to Brenton.
Believe me</p>

<p class="left70">Yours most faithfully,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thomas Troubridge.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez. </p></div>

<p>Thus released from the painful anxiety for the safety of the Channel
islands, where so many of his dearest connexions resided, he wrote the
following letter to his brother, Sir Thomas Saumarez, who was at that
time in command of the local force in Guernsey:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Ushant, 30th May 1801.</p>

<p>I have received your kind letter of the 17th, and am happy to hear that a
considerable force has been sent for the protection of Guernsey and the other
islands. They cannot be too well taken care of, when we consider the infinite
mischief they would do to Great Britain, should they fall into the enemy's
hands.</p>

<p>I am in daily expectation of being relieved by Admiral Thornbrough, after a
fourteen weeks' cruise, which is rather a longer period than the Earl intended
when I sailed from Spithead. Brenton is everything that can be desired. I have
found in him a most excellent officer and a most agreeable companion.</p></div>

<p>It appears by his journal, that on the following day he received the
welcome orders which put an end to his long and harassing cruise; also
a private letter of importance from Earl Spencer: and, being relieved
by Admiral Thornbrough on the 1st of June, he arrived on the 2nd at
Cawsand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> Bay. Having reported the return of the C&aelig;sar, he received in
answer the following letters from Earl St. Vincent and Mr. Nepean:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Admiralty, 4th June 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>I am glad the C&aelig;sar is in Cawsand Bay, because you will be the sooner informed
of his Majesty's most gracious intentions towards you, in which I have greater
pleasure than I can express, as you are to be placed at the head of a detached
squadron destined for a very important service, at no great distance from home.
I hope the C&aelig;sar will not be long in fitting up.</p>

<p class="left70">Yours most truly,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.</p>

<hr class="c15" />
<p class="right">Admiralty Office, 4th June 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have received, and communicated to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
your letter to me of the 2nd instant, acquainting me, for their lordships'
information, of your arrival in H.M.S. C&aelig;sar, in Cawsand Bay, in pursuance of
orders from Admiral Cornwallis, a copy of which you have enclosed: and I have
their lordships' commands to signify their directions to you to use every
exertion in completing the stores and provisions of the said ship, as also of
the Spencer; and, having so done, remain with the said ships in Cawsand Bay, in
constant readiness to proceed on service, when you shall receive their
lordships' orders for that purpose.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Evan Nepean.</span></p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>The following is the reply to Earl St. Vincent's letter of the 4th
June, dated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Cawsand Bay, 6th June.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>Previously to receiving the honour of your lordship's letter, I had been
informed by Earl Spencer of his Majesty's gracious intentions; and I beg to
express my sincere acknowledgments for the part your lordship has taken in
obtaining for me this mark of the royal favour.</p>

<p>I am much flattered by the communication your lordship has the goodness to make
of having nominated me for the command of a squadron to be employed on a very
particular service; and I beg your lordship will be assured of my most zealous
exertions for the promotion of every part of it. I have the honour to be,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>

<p>On the 7th of June, Sir James received the following communication
from the Lords of the Admiralty, which could not fail to afford him
the highest gratification.</p>

<p>Most secret.</p>

<p class="center">By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Whereas we have received information that a squadron consisting of five Spanish
ships of the line, which lately sailed from Ferrol, have arrived at Cadiz; and
that great exertions are now making at the last-mentioned place for the
equipment of a further naval force, for the purpose (it is alleged) of an attack
upon Portugal; we send you herewith copies of the several letters containing the
information mentioned: and do hereby direct you, on the arrival of the Hannibal,
Audacious, and Thames, at Plymouth, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>to take them under your command, (their
captains being directed to follow your orders,) as also the Spencer, and either
the Juste, Pomp&eacute;e, or Courageux, now in Cawsand Bay, whichever may first be
ready, and proceed with them and the C&aelig;sar, with as little delay as possible,
off Cadiz, where you may expect to be joined by the Venerable and Superb, which
ships you are also to take under your command; and use your best endeavours to
prevent the enemy's ships at that port from putting to sea, or to take or
destroy them should they sail from thence.</p>

<p>In the event of the enemy's squadron getting out of Cadiz undiscovered, either
before or after your arrival off that place, you are to follow it, according to
any well-grounded intelligence you may be able to obtain of it; but you are not
to proceed in quest of it to any distant station, unless you should receive such
information as shall leave no doubt of the certainty of the enemy's destination.
If you should not be able to obtain any information of the enemy's squadron so
as to enable you to follow it, you are in that case to repair with the ships
under your command off the Straits, and send into Tangier and Gibraltar, and,
finding that it has proceeded up the Mediterranean, to follow it; but, not
gaining any intelligence of it, you are to resume your station off Cadiz, and
remain there until you shall receive some information whereby your proceedings
may be regulated.</p>

<p>And whereas it has been represented to us that three Portuguese ships of the
line are now fitting out in the Tagus for the purpose of joining you and serving
under your orders, you are, on the arrival of the said ships, to take them under
your command, and employ them in such manner as you may judge most advisable in
carrying these, or any other orders you may receive from us or from Admiral Lord
Keith, (under whose command you are to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>consider yourself,) into execution. And
whereas we have directed Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley to order one of the hired
brigs, and either a cutter or lugger, to follow your orders; you are to take the
commanders of these vessels under your command, and, on your repairing to your
station, you are to send one of them into the Tagus for the purpose of apprizing
his Majesty's minister there of your situation, and for obtaining from him such
intelligence as he may have to give you.</p>

<p>Whilst you remain on this service, you are to send occasionally to Lisbon for
intelligence, and to keep a good look-out for any French squadron which may
attempt either to join the Spanish ships at Cadiz, or to pass through the
Straits; and to use your best endeavours to intercept, and to take or destroy
it, if the force you may have with you should be sufficient to enable you to do
so; taking care to avoid it in time, if the enemy's force should be so superior
to that under your command as to render it improper for you to attack it; in
which case it is left to your discretion to act as circumstances shall require:
using, however, every possible exertion to join the commander-in-chief of his
Majesty's ships in the Mediterranean, or to fall in with the same detachment of
his Majesty's ships; and, so soon as you shall have collected such a force as
may be sufficient to enable you to attack the enemy's squadron, you are to
proceed in quest of it, and, upon falling in with it, to bring it to action.</p>

<p>In case you should get sight of a French squadron, or should obtain certain
information that such squadron has passed the Straits, you are no longer to
attend to the Spanish ships in Cadiz, but to consider the capture or destruction
of the French squadron as the principal object to which your exertions are to be
directed; and, in the event of your following any squadron into the
Mediterranean, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>you are to send an account thereof to our secretary, as well as
to Admiral Lord Keith, with as little delay as possible; and you are also to
transmit to him and the said admiral, by every proper opportunity that may
offer, accounts of your proceedings, and of every information you may be able to
obtain of the movements and intentions of the enemy.</p>

the above letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">No. 1.</p>
<p class="right">Dated Lisbon, 15th May 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>It appears, from the report of an American captain arrived here from Bilboa,
that a French corps had passed within a few miles of that place, on their way to
Vittoria, on the 21st and 22nd ultimo. It consisted in the whole of 7,000
infantry and 2,000 cavalry, well armed and mounted; and had reached their place
of encampment, supposed to be Burgos, according to the accounts which had
arrived at Bilboa, on the 30th day, when the vessel sailed. It appeared evident
that no other troops had passed the frontier at that time, though it was
uniformly reported that a body of no less than 22,000 men were collected at
Bayonne.</p>

<p>The Spanish army on the south side of the Tagus, between Badajos and Alcantara,
amounts to 21,000 men; of which 10,000 are encamped at Badajos, 8,000 at
Albuquerque,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> and the remainder between Vincenti and Alcantara. The Prince of
Peace was daily expected at head-quarters. His aides-de-camp were already
arrived, and a train of 700 mules had been collected for the conveyance of his
baggage. The French detachment was destined to join the army of Castile, which I
already mentioned to your lordship has returned from its movements towards the
northern provinces, and taken a position to the southward of Ciudad Rodrigo. Its
numbers and distribution are not so accurately known, but it is stated to be
equal to the army of Estremadura, with the addition of the French auxiliaries.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>By intelligence which arrived from Cadiz, in date of the second of this month,
it appears that there were in that port five Spanish ships of the line, which
had pushed out from Ferrol, conformably to the report which I mentioned to your
lordship in my last despatch. There was at the same time (in Cadiz) an
additional force of eight or ten sail preparing for sea; four of them of the
line, and the remainder frigates. This equipment was however retarded by the
want of naval stores, particularly sailcloth and cables, which was occasioned by
the late fire which has taken place in the arsenal, as well as by the total want
of money, which was such that many of the officers were actually reduced to
subsist on charity.</p>

<p>The informant, whose authority may be depended on, adds that a squadron from
Brest was expected to join them. It was supposed that the whole armament would
be directed against Portugal; and this supposition was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>not weakened by a report
which was given out industriously that the object of the intended expedition was
to make a landing on the coast of Barbary, in order to force the Emperor of
Morocco to shut his ports against the English. The ships from Ferrol have the
French and Spanish colours united in the same flag. It was understood that the
ships now arming in Cadiz were to be commanded by French officers. They were
victualled only for a very short voyage.</p>

<p>Respecting the danger to which this capital would be exposed by a <span class="italic">coup-de-main</span>,
which might be attempted in spite of the batteries at the entrance of the river,
as well as the possibility of effecting a landing a few miles off Cascaes, your
lordship has at hand the means of information so much superior to any which I
could presume to offer, or collect from professional persons here, that I shall
only presume to solicit your lordship's attention to the consideration of this
subject, and to the necessity which may arise out of it, for employing a naval
force upon this station. Don Rodrigo has informed me that the three Portuguese
ships of the line, which I mentioned to your lordship as preparing for service,
will be ready within three weeks to form a junction with any force which his
Majesty might be pleased to detach, for the defence of Portugal; and that two
more would be prepared to follow them within a short time after.</p>

<p>It appears by a letter from Viana, that the master of an English vessel, who had
been captured on the 10th ultimo by Le Telegraph privateer, and carried into
Corunna on the 23rd, had found there two large French frigates, which had
arrived immediately before him in eight days from Cherbourg, laden with some
ammunition, and destined (as they reported) for Cadiz. The master of Le
Telegraph had avoided putting into any of his own ports from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>apprehension
of being detained, as it was reported that other privateers had been stopped,
and stripped of their men, on account of a secret expedition which was fitting
out in the French ports.</p>

<p class="p2 right">C&aelig;sar, Cawsand Bay, 9th June 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of their lordships' secret orders,
dated 6th instant; and, in compliance therewith, I have directed Captain
Stirling, of his Majesty's ship Pomp&eacute;e, to put himself under my command.</p>

<p>Be pleased to inform their lordships that Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley has
acquainted me that there is no hired armed brig at this port except the Louisa,
and has placed the Joseph, hired cutter, only under my orders.</p>

<p class="left65">I am, sir,<br /></p>
<span class="left5">Your most obedient servant,</span>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Evan Nepean, Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>We need scarcely add that every possible exertion was made on the part
of the admiral, the captains, officers, and crews of the respective
ships, to get the squadron ready for sea; and in eight days the
equipment was completed.</p>

<p>Before we record a circumstance which, in rewarding the merits of the
new commander-in-chief, afforded great and universal satisfaction to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the royal navy, we take occasion to introduce a correspondence, which,
in order to avoid interruption of the narrative, has been omitted, and
which will now be found more interesting.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Royal George, between Ushant and the Black Rocks, 26th July 1800.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Lord,</p>

<p>I need not describe to your lordship the merit of Sir James Saumarez, which
cannot be surpassed. In a conversation I accidentally had with him last evening,
I learned that his ambition had been much disappointed in not being created a
baronet; and he thought I was wanting, in not pointing to this object in the
letter I had the honour to write your lordship by him, after the battle of the
Nile, where he was second in command; and he also conceives that your lordship
led him to hope this mark of approbation of his services would have been
conferred upon him. May I therefore trespass upon your indulgence, to request
you will bring it about, if possible, as nothing can gratify me more, than that
officers, who have signalised themselves under my auspices, should be amply
rewarded.</p>

<p class="left65">Yours, most faithfully,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Vincent.</span></p>
<p>To the Right Hon. Earl Spencer.</p></div>

<p>A copy of the preceding having been sent by Earl St. Vincent to Sir
James, produced the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>Permit me to express my sincere acknowledgments for the very handsome letter you
have done me the favour to write on a certain subject to Lord Spencer. Whether
it meets with the expected success, or otherwise, I shall ever feel grateful for
your obliging intentions towards me: at the same time, I am persuaded your
lordship must coincide with my feelings, when I observe that the boon now
pointed out was no more than the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>services I had the good fortune to be employed
upon, gave me reason to expect long before this.</p>

<p>That health, and every possible success may ever attend your lordship, is the
fervent wish of</p>

<p class="left55">My dear lord,<br />
<span class="i2">Your much obliged,</span><br />
<span class="i4">and faithful humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>C&aelig;sar, 29th July 1800.</p></div>

<p>On the 13th of June, his Majesty, having taken into consideration the
meritorious services of Sir James Saumarez, was pleased to create him
a Baronet of the United Kingdom; and, as an additional mark of the
royal favour, permission was granted under the King's sign manual to
wear the supporters to the arms of his family (which had been
registered in the Heralds' office since the reign of Charles the
Second); a privilege to which no commoner is entitled without a
dispensation from the Crown. Of these honours Sir James was informed
by Earl St. Vincent, at that time First Lord of the Admiralty, at the
moment the C&aelig;sar and squadron were about to proceed on one of the most
interesting, and, as it turned out, one of the most glorious
expeditions that ever left the shores of Great Britain.</p>

<p>On the 16th June the signal was made to unmoor; and soon after, for
the squadron to weigh. The wind being fair, the ships quickly cleared
the English Channel, and crossed the Bay of Biscay. Cape Finisterre
was reached on the 22nd; on the 26th the squadron hove to off the
Tagus, and sent letters on shore at Lisbon. The detachment was now
joined by the Phaeton, Captain Morris, and proceeded off Cadiz, where
it arrived on the 28th June: to announce this, the following letter
was written to Admiral Lord Keith, who had then the chief command on
the Mediterranean station:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Cadiz, 26th June 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform your lordship of my arrival off Cadiz with the ships
named on the margin <a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>under my orders; having sailed from Cawsand Bay on the
16th instant. On the 26th I was joined, off Lisbon, by the Phaeton, Captain
Morris, from whom I received the enclosed state of the enemy's ships at Cadiz.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The Venerable and Superb have both joined the squadron; and I
have taken these ships under my orders, agreeably to my instructions from my
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>I shall take the earliest opportunity of transmitting to your lordship a copy of
those instructions; but having at present no other vessel than the Plymouth,
hired lugger, I cannot part with her further than to Gibraltar.</p>

<p class="left50">I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i2">Your lordship's most obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Right Honourable Lord Keith, K.B. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The squadron continued to cruise off Cadiz, and frequently to
reconnoitre the harbour; while the Superb was stationed off Lagos as a
look-out ship to westward, and the Thames in the Straits of Gibraltar
to the eastward.</p>

<p>Nothing of importance occurred until the 5th, when intelligence was
received as to the situation of a French squadron. Sir James
accordingly despatched the Plymouth lugger with the following letters
to the Secretary of the Admiralty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> and to Mr. Frere, the English
ambassador at Lisbon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Cadiz, 5th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>In my letter of the 29th ultimo, I acquainted you, for the information of my
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, of my arrival before Cadiz with the
squadron under my orders, and of my having been joined by the Venerable and
Superb.</p>

<p>You will please to inform their lordships, that, early this morning, a
despatch-boat joined me from Gibraltar, with intelligence that three French
line-of-battle ships and a frigate were seen, on the 1st instant, endeavouring
to pass the Straits from the eastward; and the Plymouth lugger has since joined
me, whose commander informs me that they anchored yesterday off Algeziras. As
from the different accounts I form great hopes of being able to attack them with
success, I am proceeding to the eastward, and I hope to reach the bay early
to-morrow morning. The ships in Cadiz are getting in forwardness to put to sea.
Eight appeared this morning with top-gallant yards across and sails bent, and
four others with their top-masts rigged. I have directed the commander of the
Plymouth, hired lugger, after having landed this letter at Faro, to cruise off
Cape St. Mary's to apprise any of his Majesty's ships of my rendezvous, giving
them such further information as he may be possessed of.</p>

<p class="left55">I am, sir, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Evan Nepean, Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Admiralty.</p>
<hr class="p2 c15" />
<p class="p2 right">C&aelig;sar, off Cadiz, 5th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acquaint you with my having this instant received
information, by an express from Gibraltar, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>that three sail of French
line-of-battle ships and a frigate had anchored yesterday in Algeziras Bay,
after being three days in endeavouring to pass the Straits from the eastward.
They are supposed to be destined for Cadiz. I am proceeding off Gibraltar, in
hopes it may be practicable to attack them, or prevent the junction of their
other ships, from whom they are said to be separated. I request you will please
to forward the letters I take the liberty to enclose herewith. I have the honour
to be, sir,</p>

<p class="left55">Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>

<p>Governor O'Hara writes that he is without intelligence from Egypt since the
repulse of the French, the 21st March.</p>

<p>His Excellency J.H. Frere, Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Lisbon.</p></div>

<p>It now becomes our duty to give a particular account of the defensive
means of the French Admiral. The road of Algeziras, six miles distant
from Gibraltar, is open to the eastward. It is shallow, with sunken
rocks in several parts. The town is nearly in the centre, at the
bottom of the Bay; about a third of a mile from which there is a tower
standing on a point, and off this point is Isla Verda, whereon is a
battery of seven long 24-pounders. About a mile to the southward of
this battery is Fort Santa Garcia. The English ships had to pass these
fortifications before they could reach the French line. The northward
of the town was no less protected, having at the distance of about
two-thirds of a mile the fort of San Jago, mounting five long
18-pounders, besides the tower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> Almirante. By referring to the
diagrams, it will be manifest that the road is admirably protected by
these fortifications, while those at a greater distance to the
northward would be of some service in throwing shells, and in
preventing the ships from working up to the attack. There were also
fourteen large gun-boats, whose positions, as shown, were such as to
form a serious opposition to an approaching enemy in light and
variable winds.</p>

<p>Before we proceed to a description of the attack on the enemy's
well-protected squadron, we must intreat the reader to pause, while we
call his attention to the circumstance of the British ships, led by
the gallant Hood, slowly and silently approaching the batteries of an
enemy, strongly reinforced, perfectly prepared to receive them, and
knowing well that they could not suffer any injury from the ships,
while every shot from their cannon must tell. Silence, undoubtedly
derives importance from the circumstances under which it is observed,
and we cannot well refer to an instance where silence could have had a
more solemn and impressive character than that which must have been
observed on this occasion, until broken by the roar of the enemy's
destructive engines.</p>

<p>Captain (now Admiral Sir Jahleel) Brenton, who was flag-captain of the
C&aelig;sar, has kindly transmitted the following particular and authentic
account of all that took place on that eventful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> day, which afforded
the enemy a short-lived triumph. We shall make no apology for giving
it in his own words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>On Sunday, the 5th July 1801, a despatch-boat was seen in the S.E., and at two
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> came alongside the C&aelig;sar, with intelligence of a French squadron having
anchored in Algeziras Bay, consisting of three sail of the line and a frigate.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The Admiral immediately decided on attacking them; and ordered
the Thames frigate to proceed off St. Lucar to recall the Superb, and make sail
with the Pomp&eacute;e, Hannibal, Spencer, Audacious, and Venerable, for the entrance
of the Straits of Gibraltar; making the signal to prepare for action, and for
anchoring by the stern.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful, with a light air from the westward. At eleven o'clock the
ship's company was, as usual, assembled for the purpose of Divine service. The
appearance of this congregation, under the peculiar circumstances in which they
were placed,&mdash;proceeding, as they all knew they were, to engage in battle
with the enemy, with the probability that many had but a few remaining hours to
live,&mdash;was solemn and deeply impressive. The crew were all dressed in
white, as is customary in warm climates; and being arranged according to their
respective divisions on the quarter-deck, with the band and the marines on the
poop, and the Admiral and the officers under the poop awning, an effect was
produced highly animating, solemn, and appropriate; while the meek, devotional
countenance of the well-tried Admiral indicated that he derived his confidence
and support from its only true source.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>Our chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Holliday, gave an excellent discourse,
appropriate to the occasion; and it cannot be doubted but the
impressions it made on that eventful day were deep and affecting,
however temporary.</p>

<p>I had of course much communication with the Admiral during the course
of this day and the ensuing night. He was, as usual, calm, cheerful,
and collected; foreseeing, and endeavouring to provide for, whatever
might be required during the struggle which we were anticipating. He
was quite aware of the difficulties we had to encounter, and fully
determined to overcome them if possible.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>At daylight we were off Tariffa, with light airs from the westward,
which at seven freshened to a strong breeze,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> and enabled the
Venerable to open the Bay of Algeziras, in which the French squadron
were discovered at anchor. On the Venerable making the signal that she
could weather the enemy, the Admiral made another to take stations for
mutual support. The Pomp&eacute;e, Venerable, and Audacious were soon at an
anchor, and at thirty-five minutes after eight began the action with
the enemy. The C&aelig;sar at nine o'clock opened her fire, and at fifteen
minutes past nine came to an anchor ahead of the Venerable. The
Spencer and Hannibal passed under our lee, nearly becalmed, and
anchored without the C&aelig;sar, firing, as the smoke subsided, through the
openings between our ships at the enemy.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the fire of the French ships appeared to slacken so
much that I ventured to suggest to the Admiral that a flag of truce
might be sent in, with a notice to the Spaniards that if the British
squadron were permitted to take away the French ships without any
further molestation from the batteries, the town would be respected,
and no further injury done to it.</p>

<p>The Admiral expressed his readiness to do this; but considered the
advantage we had gained, as yet, not sufficiently decisive to justify
such a measure. And his judgment was but too correct. The decrease of
the fire from the French ships arose from their being occupied in
warping close in-shore; and, shortly after this period, the Pomp&eacute;e
having broken her sheer, lost her commanding position relative to the
French Admiral, whom she had been raking with great effect, and now
became raked in her turn. At twenty minutes after ten, the boats of
the squadron were sent to her assistance, and, having cut her cables,
she was towed out of her exposed situation.</p>

<p>At thirty-five minutes after ten, the Admiral, observing how much the
enemy had increased their distance from us <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>by warping in-shore,
ordered our cables to be cut, and sail to be made upon the ships, in
the hope of being able to close with them. He also sent me on board
the Spencer, with orders to Captain Darby to weigh, and work up to the
enemy. The Hannibal, having already received these orders, was in the
act of obeying them, and soon after opened her fire upon the French
Admiral; but in the gallant endeavour to get between the Formidable
and the shore, and not being aware of the French Admiral's change of
position by warping in, Captain Ferris unfortunately ran his ship
aground, abreast of the battery of St. Jago, and under the raking fire
of the Formidable. In this helpless state he continued to engage the
enemy until, to use the French Admiral's words, his decks were <span class="italic">jonch&eacute;
de morts</span>. He had seventy-three killed and sixty-four wounded,&mdash;a very
unusual proportion, as, in general, the wounded trebles the number of
the killed; but this may be accounted for by the Hannibal being so
near that the enemy's shot passed through her sides without making any
splinters, to which the greater number of wounds are attributable.</p>

<p>From the time the C&aelig;sar cut her cable, she and the Audacious were
constantly engaged with the Indomptable, Meuron, and island batteries,
and occasionally with the Dessaix, as they could bring their guns-to
bear; but the perpetual flaws of wind rendered this very difficult,
and exposed them frequently to a severe and raking fire from the
enemy. The Admiral made the signal for the marines to be prepared to
land on the island; but, as the boats were all employed in assisting
the Pomp&eacute;e and Hannibal, this was rendered impracticable. At length,
finding every effort fruitless to close with the enemy, the Admiral
was under the necessity of withdrawing his ships from this unequal
contest with winds and batteries; but it was not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>until all hope had
vanished of saving the Hannibal that he left her in possession of the
enemy.</p></div>

<p>The accompanying diagram shows first, the position of the hostile
squadrons at the moment the Spencer, and Venerable, and C&aelig;sar, had
anchored; secondly, their position when the action ceased, and when
the Hannibal was in possession of the enemy.</p>

<p class="center">Diagram of Algeziras and Gibraltar Bay.</p>
<p class="p4"></p>

<p>The action of Algeziras was certainly obstinately fought, and gallantly
contested on both sides. It is true that the French had little to do but to
attend to their guns, being either at an anchor in their strong position, or
warping towards the shore. In this operation the Spaniards had the hardest duty,
being employed in their boats in carrying out hawsers, and even in heaving them
in. Success seemed certain to the British squadron till the Pomp&eacute;e broke her
sheer; after that, it was one continued but unavailing struggle to recover the
ground we had lost by this misfortune: and we retreated to Gibraltar when all
hope was at an end, the Admiral justly considering the importance of repairing
the damages already sustained, and of preserving the lives of his gallant crew,
which would be uselessly sacrificed by a continuance of a hopeless contest.</p>

<p>Never did I contemplate more real greatness of mind than was displayed on this
occasion by our heroic chief. The calmness and cheerfulness with which he met
and sustained the sad reverses of this most trying day, were objects worthy of
remark and admiration. Whilst going into the Bay of Algeziras, he desired me to
look over my signal-book, and to mark such signals as might be likely to be
called for. He had already done the same, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>and when, during the heat of the
action, any of the flags were destroyed, or the halliards shot away, I was
astonished at the readiness with which he ordered one signal to be substituted
for another, according as the signification might answer the purpose, without
any reference to the book.</p>

<p>On reaching our anchorage off the Mole of Gibraltar, after giving the necessary
orders for the disposal and refitting of his squadron, he returned to his cabin
with a deep sense of the responsibility he had incurred; but supported by the
unqualified conviction that every exertion had been made to obtain success, and
that the disappointment resulted from circumstances over which he had no
control.</p>

<p>The action terminated, as appears by the log, at thirty-five minutes after one;
and the squadron proceeded to Gibraltar. As soon as the ship was secured, the
Admiral sent me on shore to the governor, to relate to him the events of the two
preceding days. I found him sitting in his balcony, which commanded a view of
the Bay and Algeziras, evidently deeply affected by the unlooked-for termination
of an attack upon the French squadron, and anxiously reflecting on the probable
results.</p>

<p>On my return on board, the Admiral had retired to his cot; and I had no means of
communicating with him until next morning. I could then, however, perceive that
under all the severity of disappointment he experienced from our failure, and
the loss of the Hannibal, he felt that no honour had been lost; that every
effort had been made to obtain success; and that he derived comfort from the
sanguine hopes he entertained that an opportunity might present itself in which
he should be able to retrieve the loss.</p>

<p>He ordered me to take a flag of truce and wait upon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>the French Admiral, and
propose an exchange of prisoners; which M. Linois refused, alleging that it was
not in his power to establish a cartel for the purpose until he obtained the
sanction of the Minister of the Marine at Paris, to whom he had sent off an
express as soon as the firing had ceased on the preceding day; but he consented
to send over the officers on parole. The object of the French Admiral was very
obvious. He concluded we wanted the men to replace those that had been killed
and wounded; but he thought, justly, that sending over officers on parole would
be a harmless act of courtesy, from which we could reap no immediate benefit. It
will be seen that, subsequently to the second action, (only six days after the
first,) when his despatches from Algeziras had scarcely reached Paris, he did
not wait for an answer from the Minister of the Marine: but circumstances had
altered. We had taken a line-of-battle ship, and burned two first-rates; and he
now wished to get as many of the crew back as possible.</p></div>

<p>We shall now transcribe the Rear-admiral's official account of the
battle: this affords additional particulars, and proves that every
step had been taken to insure success; which, but from circumstances
that often blight the fairest prospects, would have had a very
different result. We shall venture to add, that, had the gallant
Admiral hesitated to make the attempt, he would have rendered himself
obnoxious to animadversions, not only from all the squadron under his
command, but from every one on the Rock of Gibraltar who witnessed the
enemy's squadron of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> inferior force setting, as it were, that of Sir
James at defiance; while it would have afforded the French and
Spaniards a just, or, at least a plausible subject of exultation. But
Sir James, with that decision of character and coolness, when in the
presence of an enemy, for which he was always remarkable, did not
hesitate one moment on the attack, which was made with consummate
skill, and maintained with a perseverance never surpassed.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Gibraltar, 6th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have to request you will be pleased to inform my Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty that, conformable to my letter of yesterday's date, I stood through
the Straits, with his Majesty's squadron under my orders, with the intention of
attacking three French line-of-battle ships and a frigate that I was informed
were at anchor off Algeziras. On opening Cabrita Point, I found the ships lay at
a considerable distance from the enemy's batteries; and having a leading wind up
to them, every reasonable hope of success in the attack was afforded.</p>

<p>I had previously directed Captain Hood in the Venerable, from his experience and
knowledge of the anchorage, to lead the squadron, which he executed with his
accustomed gallantry; and, although it was not intended he should anchor, he
found himself under the necessity of so doing, from the wind failing,&mdash;a
circumstance so much to be apprehended in this country, and to which I have to
attribute the want of success in this well-intended enterprise. Captain Stirling
anchored, conformably to the enclosed order of attack, opposite to the inner
ship of the enemy, and brought the Pomp&eacute;e to action in the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>spirited and
gallant manner; an example which was followed by the commanders of every ship in
the squadron.</p>

<p>Captains Darby and Ferris, owing to light winds, were prevented for a
considerable time from coming into action. At length, the Hannibal getting a
breeze, Captain Ferris had the most favourable prospect of being alongside one
of the enemy's ships, when the Hannibal unfortunately took the ground; and I am
extremely concerned to acquaint their lordships that, after having made every
possible effort with this ship and the Audacious to rescue her from the enemy, I
was under the necessity to make sail, being at the time only three cables'
length from one of the enemy's batteries.</p>

<p>My thanks are particularly due to all the captains and men under my orders; and,
although their endeavours have not been crowned with success, I trust the
thousands of spectators from his Majesty's garrison, and also the surrounding
coast, will do justice to their valour and intrepidity, which were not to be
checked by the fire from the numerous batteries (however formidable) that
surrounded Algeziras.</p>

<p>I feel it incumbent upon me to state to their lordships the great merits of
Captain Brenton of the C&aelig;sar, whose cool judgment and intrepid conduct, I will
venture to pronounce, were never surpassed. I also beg leave to recommend to
their lordships' notice my flag-lieutenant, Mr. Philip Dumaresq, who has served
with me from the commencement of this war, and is a most deserving officer. Mr.
Lamborn and the other lieutenants are also entitled to great praise; as well as
Captain Maxwell of the Marines, and the other officers of his corps serving on
board the C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>The enemy's ships consisted of two of eighty-four guns and one of seventy-four,
with a large frigate: two of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>former are aground, and the whole are rendered
totally unserviceable.</p>

<p>His Majesty's ships have suffered considerably in their masts and rigging; but I
hope will soon be refitted, and in readiness to proceed on service.</p>

<p>Inclosed is the return of the killed and wounded from the different ships of the
squadron. Amongst other valuable men I have most sincerely to lament the loss of
Mr. William Grave, master of the C&aelig;sar. I cannot close this letter without
rendering the most ample justice to the great bravery of Captain Ferris: the
loss in his ship must have been very considerable both in officers and men; but
I have the satisfaction to be informed that his Majesty has not lost so valuable
an officer.</p>

<p>The Honourable Captain Dundas, of his Majesty's sloop the <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Calp&eacute;'">Calpe,</ins> made his vessel
as useful as possible, and kept up a spirited fire on one of the enemy's
batteries. I have also to express my approbation of Lieutenant Janvrin,
commander of the gun-boats; who, having joined me with intelligence, served as
volunteer on board the C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p class="left55">I am,<br />
<span class="i2">Your most obedient servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Evan Nepean, Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>On the return of the squadron to the Mole of Gibraltar, the following
public order was issued by the Admiral.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, in Rosia Bay, 6th July 1801.</p>

<p>Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez desires to express in the strongest terms the
high sense he entertains of the gallantry and valiant conduct of all the
captains, officers, and men belonging to the squadron under his orders, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>the
attack made this day on the enemy's ships and batteries; and, although the
result has not proved so successful as his expectations had framed, he trusts
that the glory they have acquired on this occasion will ever be acknowledged by
their country.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To the respective Captains.</p></div>

<p>The following addition to Sir James's despatch gives the account of
the capture of the Hannibal, from Captain Ferris, then a prisoner at
Algeziras.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
C&aelig;sar, Gibraltar, 9th July 1801.
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I herewith enclose a letter from Captain Ferris of his Majesty's late ship
Hannibal, which I request you will please to lay before their lordships; and I
have only to express my deep regret that his well-meant endeavours to bring his
ship to close action should have occasioned so severe a loss. I have the honour
to be, sir,</p>

<p class="left70">Your most obedient servant,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Evan Nepean, Esq. Admiralty.</p>

<p class="right">Algeziras Bay, 7th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I have little more to tell you of the fate of his Majesty's ship Hannibal than
yourself must have observed; only, that from the number of batteries, and ships'
gun-boats, &amp;c. we had to encounter, our guns soon got knocked up; and I
found it was impossible to do anything, either for the preservation of the ship,
or for the good of the service. Our boats, sails, rigging, and springs being all
shot away, and having so many killed and wounded, as will appear by the annexed
list, I thought it prudent to strike, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>thereby preserve the lives of the
brave men that remained.</p>

<p>Had I been successful in the view before me previously to the ship taking the
ground, my praises of the conduct of my officers and ship's company could not
have exceeded their merits; but I have, notwithstanding, the satisfaction to
say, that every order was obeyed and carried into execution with that
promptitude and alacrity becoming British officers and seamen.</p>

<p class="left55">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i2">Your most obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">S. Ferris.</span></p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez.</p></div>

<p>It has now become necessary that we should notice a controversy which
has taken place between the authors of the different naval histories
on the subject of the Battle of Algeziras; and we have been led to
make minute inquiries, first, into the cause of the discrepancies of
the different accounts; and, secondly, into the truth, which we have
been the better able to do from our personal knowledge and recent
communication with some of the officers of the Hannibal and C&aelig;sar, on
whose veracity we can depend. We are happy to add that the result of
our inquiries has been satisfactory, and, we trust, will completely
clear up and reconcile the facts, while it will leave no reflection of
a dubious character on the conduct of the heroic commander of the
squadron.</p>

<p>It appears that no difference of opinion arose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> on this subject until
the court-martial of Captain Ferris, which took place on the 1st
September 1801, at Portsmouth, Rear-admiral Holloway president; when,
as usual on trials for the loss of a ship, Captain Ferris read his
narrative, which he begins thus:</p>

<p>"In giving a detail of the circumstances which led to the loss of his
Majesty's late ship Hannibal, I am sorry that, owing to my clerk being
killed, whose remarks were lost,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> I cannot be so particular as to
the exact times of signals being made as I otherwise should have been;
but I shall state them to you to the best of my recollection."</p>

<p>After this admission, is it not surprising that the controversy should
be mainly founded on the time at which the Hannibal struck her
colours? Captain Ferris says, "about two o'clock;" while by the log of
the C&aelig;sar the action had entirely ceased at thirty-five minutes past
one. It may be asked, why did not the court, which must have seen the
discrepancy between his narrative and the public and other documents
before it, inquire into the truth by requiring the evidence of the
officers and crew, none of whom were examined as to the time the ship
struck: but the duty of the court being confined to the trial of
Captain Ferris, his officers and crew, and it being (whether
supported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> or not) evident and notorious that they had defended their
ship to the last extremity, they had (unluckily for Sir James) nothing
to do but to pronounce an honourable acquittal.</p>

<p>The next contradiction which appears, relates to the boats which were
sent to the assistance of the Hannibal. Captain Ferris says, "The
Admiral, having previously made my signal of recall, sent a boat from
the C&aelig;sar, and another from the Venerable, to my assistance; but,
finding they could afford me none, I sent the Venerable's boat back,
and the crew of the C&aelig;sar in one of my own cutters, their pinnace
having been sunk by a shot alongside."</p>

<p>I am bound to say that this assertion is not borne out either by the
testimony of those who were in the boats of the C&aelig;sar and the
Venerable, or by the officers of the Hannibal; because, as will be
seen hereafter, these boats never reached the Hannibal, when aground,
until after she had struck her colours.</p>

<p>Captain Ferris next relates that "About twelve o'clock our ships were
all out of gun-shot of the enemy, and we had the fire of the whole
French squadron, batteries, and gun-boats, to contend with alone;
against which we continued to keep up as brisk a fire as could be
expected, even by men in the most sanguine anticipation of victory,
until near two o'clock."</p>

<p>Now this is quite impossible, as, by the log of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> every ship, the
squadron was engaging much later: by the C&aelig;sar, until 1h.35m.; by the
Audacious, until 1h.20m.; by the Venerable, until 1h.30m. &amp;c.;
before which, the ensign of the Hannibal was seen, from every ship,
<span class="italic">Union down</span>.</p>

<p>It has been unwarrantably alleged by some that the Hannibal hauled the
ensign down, and then hoisted it reversed, as a signal of distress,
and afterwards, when she struck, hauled it down; and that the French
hoisted it union down to decoy the <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Calp&eacute;'">Calpe,</ins>. But, for the refutation of
these absurdities, we must refer the reader to the testimony of
Colonel Connolly, who was then acting captain of the marines, an
officer of the highest character, whose veracity cannot be questioned;
and who, moreover, from being the only officer on the poop when the
colours were struck, had a better opportunity of knowing the facts
than any other. The following are the questions which we put to
Colonel Connolly, with his answers, given verbatim:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>Did the enemy take possession of the Hannibal before the colours were hoisted
union down?</p>

<p>The colours were hauled down by Captain Ferris's orders, and remained so; but,
being so near the Formidable, the captain of her was on board of us in two
minutes after we had struck, and the colours were hoisted <span class="italic">union downwards</span> by the
Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>Were the colours hoisted union down by the enemy; or, at any time, by Captain
Ferris's orders?</p>

<p>By the enemy.</p>

<p>Did the boats come <span class="italic">before</span> or <span class="italic">after</span> the colours were hoisted union downwards, to
render her assistance?</p>

<p>The boats from our ships did not get near us till after we were in possession of
the enemy; and I called to an old shipmate of mine in the Venerable's barge, and
told him so, as he came under the starboard quarter; but he persisted in coming
on board, and was taken.</p>

<p>What boats were taken; and what boats escaped?</p>

<p>A good many were taken. The Venerable's barge and her first lieutenant; and
another lieutenant, in the C&aelig;sar's boat, of some ship lying at Gibraltar; beside
the mids. I am not aware indeed that any escaped.</p>

<p>What French officer took possession of the Hannibal?</p>

<p>I am not quite certain whether it was the captain of the Formidable or the
Dessaix; they were both very close to us: however, he was a very little fellow.</p>

<p>To what prison were you taken?</p>

<p>The ship's company were divided into two prisons, which appeared to have been
stables. There was no water in one of them, and the distress of our poor
fellows, on that account, was truly shocking: often, when they would give money
to the people outside to bring them some to drink, they would walk off with it,
and never bring the water.</p></div>

<p>On this occasion Colonel Connolly recognised a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> French officer who had
been a short time previously a prisoner on board the Warrior, to whom
he had been particularly civil, supplying him with linen, &amp;c.; and who
left the ship with protestations of his desire to make every return in
his power, if the "fortune of war" should give him an opportunity: but
when he claimed the performance of his promise, his reply was,
"Monsieur de Connolly, I very sorry for your misfortune; but I wish
you good morning!" and left him with a sarcastic sneer.</p>

<p>It is evident, from this testimony, that the colours were only struck
once, and hoisted once union down, and only hoisted union down by the
Frenchmen; and that the boats of the C&aelig;sar and Venerable were only
once on board the Hannibal after she was aground; namely, when their
crews were taken prisoners. But both these boats were actually sent to
her assistance at a previous period, when the Hannibal was directed by
the Admiral to endeavour to obtain a position to rake the Formidable;
and it was then that they were sent back. Captain Brenton first
received the report of the Hannibal having her colours union downwards
between twelve and one, while the C&aelig;sar was engaging the island
battery, and the Dessaix and the Muiron.</p>

<p>The C&aelig;sar's boat was sent with others to the assistance of the
Hannibal, according to the log, at seventeen minutes past one, and
must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> reached her certainly before the action ceased, and found
her in the hands of the enemy, as described by Colonel Connolly.</p>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that, while actually engaging the enemy,
Captain Ferris would haul down his colours, to hoist them as a signal
of distress, when he had other ensigns to hoist, and when there was a
signal in the book, "In distress, and in want of immediate
assistance:" this is a circumstance which, I will venture to assert,
never occurred in any naval action.</p>

<p>Captain Brenton, being decidedly of the same opinion, adds, "I can
only say, when it was reported to me, <span class="italic">while in action</span>, that the
Hannibal's colours were reversed, I considered her to be in possession
of the enemy: that the Admiral took the same view of the subject, I
have not the least doubt; and I think nothing would have induced him
to abandon the Hannibal while she was engaged. I will further add,
that I never remember the slightest doubt being expressed of the
Hannibal having struck before the action terminated, until I read the
narrative of Captain Ferris, at his court-martial, some time
afterwards."</p>

<p>The moment these champions of "libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, et la mort," entered
the Hannibal, plunder was the order of the day; and, in their furious
haste to get at the officers' trunks, they cruelly trod over the
wounded in the cockpit and cable-tiers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> Colonel Connolly relates that
in a few minutes one of them had taken his new cocked-hat, and
appeared on deck with it. He himself had given up seeking his desk,
which contained a considerable sum of money besides valuable papers,
because he could not get at it without creeping over the wounded; but
the French, not so particular, soon found it.</p>

<p>We shall now give the extracts of the various logs to which we have
had access. These have never yet been published, and we trust they
will set the matter at rest. It is some satisfaction indeed, that all
authors agree in declaring that nothing more could have been done, and
that the honour of the British flag was to the last gloriously
maintained on the 6th of July 1801.</p>

twenty-five wounded, and seven missing; at 5h. came-to at Gibraltar, with the
small bower employed warping alongside of the sheer hulk.</p></div>

<p>The Venerable's log, which we have examined at the dep&ocirc;t at Deptford,
and which is signed by Captain Hood, fully corroborates the above,
with the addition,&mdash;"At 12h.40m. sent the first lieutenant in the
pinnace to assist the Hannibal;" and this officer (Lieutenant Collis)
in his own journal mentions the same fact. When he arrived at the
Hannibal, she was in possession of the enemy; and he was taken
prisoner, with his boat's crew, by persisting to go on board after he
was warned by Lieutenant (now Colonel) Connolly, of the Marines. He
says it was in consequence of the ensign being reversed that the boats
were sent; and, before any of the boats reached her, she was in
possession of the French, who hoisted the colours union downwards
themselves, and that they never were hoisted in that manner at any
other time.</p>

<p>These facts are also corroborated by the logs and journals of the
Audacious and Spencer, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> will be given in the next chapter. Every
ship, indeed, mentions the impossibility of affording any assistance
to the Hannibal, and that the signal was not made to leave off action
until her situation was utterly hopeless.</p>

<p>The nature of the well-protected road of Algeziras being fully
manifest in the diagram facing the 346th page, it is unnecessary to
point out the difficulties the squadron had to contend with from the
five strong batteries, which were served with much effect by the
French artillerymen. The numerous gun-boats stationed at Algeziras for
the annoyance of our commerce, were from their constant practice in
that kind of warfare, of themselves a most formidable enemy; besides,
the assistance they afforded in warping their ships in-shore, and
placing them in such a position as to enable the different batteries
to support them. But the failure of the attack must be mainly
attributed to the unsteadiness and faintness of the wind, which
enabled none of the squadron to obtain the position it wished; that
is, in-shore of the enemy: while, by falling calm at a moment the most
disadvantageous, it left the ships exposed to the enemy's fire without
the possibility of returning it.</p>

<p>The loss sustained by each ship was severe. The C&aelig;sar had her master,
Mr. William Grave, six seamen, and two marines, killed; her boatswain,
G.W. Forster, seventeen seamen, one boy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> six marines, wounded;
besides the capture of Lieutenant Janvarin, a volunteer, Mr. Richard
Best, and seven seamen, who were taken by boarding the Hannibal when
in possession of the enemy. Her masts, particularly the main-mast, and
yards, were very much injured; her boats were all cut to pieces,
besides that taken at the Hannibal; and there were many shots in her
hull. The Pomp&eacute;e had Mr. P. Roxborough, master, Mr. Stewart,
midshipman, ten seamen, and three marines killed; Lieutenants
Cheesman, Stapleton, and Innes, Messrs. Currie, Hillier, and Hibbert,
fifty-three seamen, and ten marines, wounded. She was so completely
damaged in masts, rigging, and sails, that all hope of refitting her
as promptly as the rest was at an end. The Spencer had Mr. Spencer, a
midshipman, and five seamen, killed; Mr. Chatterton, midshipman,
twenty-three seamen, and three marines wounded. She was damaged
chiefly in her rigging and sails, which were soon repaired. The
Venerable had Mr. W. Gibbons, midshipman, and eight seamen, killed;
Messrs. Austin and Collins, midshipmen, twenty seamen, and four
marines, wounded; and eight missing. The Hannibal had seventy-five
killed, among whom were Mr. D. Lindsay, clerk, and Lieut. James
Williams, R.M.; and seventy wounded and missing. The Audacious had
eight killed; Lieut. Day, of the Marines, thirty-one seamen and
marines, wounded. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> total loss of the squadron being one hundred
and twenty-three killed, two hundred and forty-two wounded, and
twenty-two missing.</p>

<p>The loss of the French and Spaniards, by their own accounts, was
considerable; the former having three hundred and six killed,&mdash;among
whom were Captains Moncousu, of the Dessaix, seventy-four, and
Lalonde, of the Indomptable, eighty-four,&mdash;and near five hundred
wounded; five gun-boats were sunk, and others damaged; and the forts,
in which eleven men were killed, received considerable injury. The
ships suffered a good deal in hull, masts, and rigging; but not so
much as was anticipated.</p>

<p>The French, as might be expected, from their usual disregard to truth,
made this out one of the most brilliant exploits ever performed. Their
account stated that three French ships had completely beaten six
English, which took refuge in Gibraltar after leaving the Hannibal in
their possession, &amp;c.; saying nothing of the heavy batteries and
gun-boats they had to contend with. But the Spaniards, in the Madrid
Gazette extraordinary, represented the "action as very obstinate and
bloody on both sides; and likewise on the part of the batteries, which
decided the fate of the day:" and in another place, "the fire of our
batteries was so hot and well supported that the enemy suffered most
from them; and particularly it is to the St. Jago we owe the capture
of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> English ship, for her bold man&oelig;uvre of attempting to pass
between the French Rear-admiral's ship, the Formidable, and the shore,
made her take the ground; and, notwithstanding the utmost exertions to
get her afloat, it was found impossible to move her. Then the fire
from the battery very soon dismasted her, and compelled her to
strike.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The diagram, besides pointing out the situations of the five strong
batteries, which so completely protect the harbour, and which did the
greatest execution, shows the first position of the ships about the
time they all anchored, and before the enemy's ships had warped near
the shore. The second, represented by the outlines, shows the
situation of the hostile squadrons at the time the Hannibal struck,
when the Pomp&eacute;e had nearly reached the Mole, the distance of which
from Algeziras is little more than four miles, and the Spencer was
considerably advanced in that direction.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude our account of this action without a few remarks on
the circumstances we have related. There cannot be a doubt that, had
the enemy remained in the position he held at the commencement of the
action, every ship would have been taken. Praise is certainly due to
Admiral Linois for his able man&oelig;uvre of warping his ships aground,
being the only chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> he had of escaping; while it was acknowledging
that, as long as his ships were continued afloat, he had no confidence
in protection from the batteries, strong as they were, against the
valour and perseverance of British seamen.</p>

<p>Although the attack was not crowned with the success it merited, in a
national point of view the result was as complete as if the whole
squadron had been destroyed, as the enemy were thereby prevented from
proceeding further in the execution of the ulterior object of their
expedition; and the chance of this alone was sufficient to justify Sir
James in this bold and daring attempt, which, it will be seen,
ultimately led to one of the most glorious achievements which adorn
the annals of the empire.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">Copy of the Log of his Majesty's ship Spencer, 6th July 1801.</p>

<p>Moderate and cloudy,&mdash;spoke his Majesty's ship C&aelig;sar, which informed us of
having intelligence of three sail of French line-of-battle ships and a frigate
being in Algeziras <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>Bay,&mdash;answered the signal to prepare for battle at
anchor,&mdash;employed clearing ship for battle at anchor; at 6h. Apes hill S.
E.; at half-past 6 beat the general to quarters,&mdash;ship clear for action;
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> light airs and variable; at 4h. sprung up a breeze from the westward; at
7h.58m. saw three French sail-of-the-line and one frigate, lying under the
protection of the Spanish batteries of Algeziras, and a strong fortified island
to the southward, and a number of forts and redoubts to the westward of them.</p>

<p>At 8h.17m. the batteries commenced firing on the Venerable, Pomp&eacute;e, and
Audacious,&mdash;Venerable commenced firing; at 9h.11m. we commenced firing; at
9h.35m. found the sheet-cable cut through by the enemy's shot; at 9h. 48m.
anchored between the C&aelig;sar and the Hannibal, Audacious astern, the Pomp&eacute;e on our
larboard bow, having a battery and the French Admiral's ship to oppose us on our
larboard beam, a battery and gun-boats ahead; at 10h.33m. dismasted and
disabled a gun-boat that was rowing to the assistance of the others; at 10h.
39m. cut the cable per Admiral's order whilst wearing,&mdash;the gun-boats
attempted to approach us from under the land, but the brisk fire that was kept
up made them retreat in great disorder; at 11h.3m. answered the signal to come
to the wind on the larboard tack (No. 98); at 11h.7m. commenced firing at the
outer ships of the enemy, which was kept up at intervals.</p>

<p>At 11h.37m. observed the Hannibal under the batteries at the north end of the
town, with her main-top-mast shot away and aground, but keeping up a brisk fire
on the enemy's ships and batteries; <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Hannibal still on shore, but keeping up
a brisk fire at the enemy's ships and batteries; at 1h.16m. observed the
Hannibal to slacken her fire, shortly after the ensign hauled down and hoisted
union <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>downwards; at 1h.35m. observed the enemy's boats boarding the Hannibal;
at 1h.44m. ceased firing,&mdash;found the ship had suffered considerably in her
hull, having several shots on both sides between wind and water. Our loss in the
action was six killed, twenty-seven badly wounded, two of whom died of their
wounds. The fore-mast, bowsprit, main-top-mast, main-top-gallant yard, and
main-top-sail yard badly wounded; the boats and booms shot through in several
places; the cutter and yawl that were towing astern were sunk by the enemy. At
6h.30m. anchored per signal, and moored ship in Rosia Bay, Gibraltar.</p></div>

<p>The following is a correct copy of the Audacious's log, at Somerset
House.</p>

<p>This log, like the former, begins in the evening of the 5th July 1801.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Wind S.W. <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> moderate and hazy; half-past 2 tacked,&mdash;Cape Trafalgar S.

four or five leagues,&mdash;shortened sail to let the Pomp&eacute;e go ahead to her
station; at half-past 7, saw the enemy's ships at anchor in Algeziras Roads,
consisting of three line-of-battle ships, a frigate, gun-boats, &amp;c.;
three-quarters past 7, the batteries commenced firing on our ships as they
passed; twenty minutes past 8, the enemy's ships began to fire on our ships; at
half-past 8, the action became hot on both sides,&mdash;the Venerable, Pomp&eacute;e,
and Audacious as yet only in action; at half-past 9, the C&aelig;sar, Spencer, and
Hannibal joined the action against the ships and batteries; at 11h. cut the
cables, and tried to tow the ship's head round to the eastward, to bring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>the
ship's broadside to bear on her opponent, but without effect; by this time the
sails and rigging being much cut up, and the ship unmanageable, got the kedge
anchor with a five-inch hawser out on the starboard bow, and succeeded in
bringing the broadside to bear; at noon, light airs inclining to
calm,&mdash;C&aelig;sar, Spencer, under way, still in action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">p.m.</span> dark weather; at forty-five minutes past 12, the Venerable and Pomp&eacute;e
hauled to the wind on the starboard tack; at 1h. cut the sheet-cable, and
slipped the end of the kedge hawser, and spring on the sheet-anchor,&mdash;got
the boats ahead to tow,&mdash;found the ship drifting under the island fort,
which did us considerable injury,&mdash;the rocks close under the
lee-bow,&mdash;cut away the best bower-anchor to check her head, and bring her
broadside to bear, it being calm; at twenty minutes past 1, a light breeze
sprung up off-shore,&mdash;cut away the best bower-cable, and made sail on the
starboard tack,&mdash;observed the Hannibal on shore, and the enemy take
possession of her; at 4h. anchored in Rosia Bay, Gibraltar.</p></div>

<p>The next is the journal of Captain Hood of the Venerable.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">6th July 1801.</p>

<p>Monday, 6th July, wind variable off Algeziras,&mdash;Gibraltar Bay, light
breezes, and variable,&mdash;the captain went on board the C&aelig;sar,&mdash;all sail
set,&mdash;squadron in company,&mdash;the captain returned,&mdash;got the
sheet-cable through the stern-port, and bent it to the anchor,&mdash;got springs
on the sheet and bower-anchors; at 2h. Captain Hood went on board the Admiral;
at 3h. returned,&mdash;received a midshipman and seven men per the Plymouth
lugger, and from the Boladore, Spanish lugger; at 4h. Cape Trafalgar, N.E. seven
or eight miles,&mdash;all sail set,&mdash;made and shortened <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>sail occasionally
for the squadron, and tacked occasionally,&mdash;<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> do. weather; at 4h. made
more sail; at 7h. discovered the enemy, consisting of three two-decked ships and
a frigate, with an Admiral's flag flying, at anchor under the town and batteries
of Algeziras, protected by many gun-boats, &amp;c.&mdash;all sail set, standing
in for the enemy, followed by the Pomp&eacute;e, Audacious, C&aelig;sar, Spencer, and
Hannibal; at 7h.50m. the batteries opened their fire on us,&mdash;Pomp&eacute;e and
Audacious one mile and a half distant from us astern.</p>

<p>At 8h. it fell calm; at 8h.20m. the Pomp&eacute;e and Audacious, bringing up the
breeze, passed us to windward, when the enemy's ships opened their fire on us;
at 8h.14m. a light air sprung up,&mdash;passed the Audacious to leeward, at
which time the Pomp&eacute;e and Audacious opened their fire; at 8h. 20m. the breeze
dying away, came to with the sheet-anchor, as did the Pomp&eacute;e and
Audacious,&mdash;hove in the spring; and at 8h.30m. opened our fire on the
French Admiral's ship: at 10h. the C&aelig;sar anchored on our bow, and sent a spring
on board of us; at the same time the action became general, and the Hannibal got
on shore, after attempting to cut off the French Admiral's ship.</p>

<p>At 10h.20m. the Pomp&eacute;e drifted between us and the French Admiral's,&mdash;hove
in our spring, and brought our guns to bear on the other enemy's ship on our
bow, and the other's stern: at 12h. the Pomp&eacute;e drifted between our fire and the
enemy's,&mdash;slipt the sheet-cable, and eight-inch hawser, the spring, with
the intention of getting alongside the enemy's southernmost ship,&mdash;light
air springing up at the time from the N.E.; in awaiting this opportunity, the
mizen-top-mast, fore-braces, and jibb halyards, with various other standing and
running rigging, shot away, and main-mast badly wounded: at 11h.15m. breeze
dying away prevented our intention,&mdash;opened our fire on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>southernmost
ship; at 12h. calm and hazy,&mdash;C&aelig;sar, Hannibal, Audacious, Spencer, and us
still firing on the enemy's ships, batteries, and gun-boats,&mdash;boats of the
squadron towing off the Pomp&eacute;e to Gibraltar; <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> calm,&mdash;still firing on
the enemy's ships, which were warping farther in-shore.</p>

<p>At 12h.40m. sent Lieutenant Collis in the pinnace to assist the Hannibal; at
1h.40m. finding it impossible to near the enemy's ships with safety, it being
calm, and a strong current setting in-shore, their batteries firing red-hot shot
and throwing shells, ceased the action as per signal, as did the other ships,
and steered for Gibraltar,&mdash;observed the Hannibal ceased firing, and hoist
the colours reversed, having her fore and mainmasts shot away, and being in ten
foot water, rendered all assistance useless.</p>

<p>24 Nov. 1801.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">S. Hood.</span></p></div>

<p>Thus the logs and journals of the captains and officers of the
Spencer, Audacious, Venerable, and C&aelig;sar, all agree that the Hannibal
struck her colours between 1h.20m. and 1h.40m. The Pomp&eacute;e, being by
this time near the Mole at Gibraltar, could not see nor take minutes
of that circumstance. The Spencer, according to her position at that
time, was in the best situation for seeing the Hannibal, and
accordingly her log is the most particular. The C&aelig;sar's log need not
be given, as it would be merely a repetition of Captain Brenton's
narrative. All these agree with Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> Connolly's testimony, and
their evidence is quite conclusive as to the following facts; namely,
that the Hannibal struck her colours before the main-mast fell; that
these colours were hoisted union down by the enemy, who had possession
of the ship before the boats came alongside from the Venerable and
C&aelig;sar, and that to save her was quite impossible.</p>

<p>The following further particulars relative to the action are given in
the extract of a letter from an officer of the C&aelig;sar, dated at
Gibraltar:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>There is one point that needs explanation; namely, when the C&aelig;sar cut her cable
at half-past ten o'clock, it was from a fine breeze springing up, and the hope
of closing with the enemy. Orders were given for that purpose to the Audacious
and Venerable; the C&aelig;sar wore round them, and brought her broadside to bear on
the Indomptable's bow, lying there (about three cables distant from her) a
considerable time, with the fore-top-sail to the mast (aback). The Audacious,
bringing up a breeze from the north-west, passed between us and the enemy, who,
in this part of the day, suffered materially, his fore-top-mast going about five
minutes before twelve o'clock. Shortly afterwards, the Audacious and C&aelig;sar were
becalmed upon the broadside of the Indomptable, without being able to bring one
of their guns to bear,&mdash;the C&aelig;sar not more than three cables' length from
the island battery, and the Audacious still nearer,&mdash;both ships drifting on
the reef.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Sir James Saumarez formed the resolution of attacking
the island with marines. Boats were signalised for the purpose; but, being all
employed with the Pomp&eacute;e, or sunk by the enemy's fire, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>found
impracticable. A breeze again sprung up, and Sir James directed his ship to be
laid alongside of the Indomptable, in the firm resolution of carrying her. The
sails were trimmed for that purpose as well as the crippled state of the masts
would allow, but a calm ensued. The Venerable had never received the breeze from
the time of her cutting, and still lay unmanageable. The Spencer had drifted
considerably in repairing her rigging.</p></div>

<p>The following is a translation of the Spanish official account of the
battle of Algeziras, 6th July 1801:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The division of three French line-of-battle ships and one frigate, under the
command of Rear-admiral Citizen Linois, that sailed from the road of Toulon on
the 25th last June, destined for Cadiz, came in sight of this station and bay on
the 1st of July; and, the Levant wind having failed on entering the Straits,
they cruised between the coast of Africa and that of Europe, in which they
captured the English brig of war the Speedy, of sixteen guns, that was a Mahon
packet, and was conducting to Gibraltar a prize, the merchant brig the Union,
loaded with oil and provisions.</p>

<p>The continuation of the westerly winds obliged the said division to come into
this port on the 5th instant, at seven in the evening. From that moment,
recollecting the desperate attacks of the English at Alexandria and Copenhagen,
we could not but expect that their squadron, which had been seen off Cadiz on
the 3rd instant, under the command of Rear-admiral Saumarez, would come and
attack this division. So it happened.</p>

<p>As soon as the English received intelligence where the French had anchored, they
steered directly for the Straits; and, on the 6th instant, at half-past six in
the morning, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>six English ships doubled the Point of Carnero, and, coming round
the island of Algeziras, advanced in a line within half cannon-shot of the
French ships. The batteries of St. Garcia and the island opened their fire upon
the English; and afterwards the frigate and republican ships.</p>

<p>As soon as the English line came opposite the French ships at anchor, they
opened upon them an animated, bold, and unremitting fire. The English Admiral
having placed himself against the French, and the British ship Hannibal being
under sail, cannonaded furiously the French Admiral, who, with superior spirit
and success, resisted them; insomuch that, having carried away the Admiral's
mizen-mast, and sails of the main and fore-mast, with no small damage of his
hull, the commander of the English ship Hannibal, despising the fire from the
battery of St. Jago, pushed on to his succour; and, intending to place the
French Admiral between two fires, by running between him and the shore, had the
imprudence, being unacquainted with his position, to place himself within a
quarter of a gun-shot of the battery, and ran aground. He relieved his Admiral,
who, after this, went out of the action; but he lost his own ship and crew, as
the fire from the battery and French Admiral dismantled him, and killed three
parts of his ship's company.</p>

<p>Until this ship's surrender, which was about the time of the retreat of the
English Admiral, the fire was constant upon the two French ships and frigate, as
well as upon the seven Spanish gun-boats, the batteries of the island, St.
Garcia, St. Jago, La Almiranta, and Almirante, which, as opportunity offered,
returned their fire.</p>

<p>The battle lasted from half-past eight o'clock in the morning, when the fort of
St. Garcia opened its fire, till two in the afternoon, when the last shot was
fired from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>the French ship Indomptable. The persevering, active, and tremendous
fire of the enemy, and that of the two nations (French and Spanish), were only
distinguishable by the prudence, skill, and greatness of soul with which the
allied chiefs directed theirs, and the audacity, temerity, and confusion which
were shown in that of the English. The idea of this kind of fighting, which we
form from the account of the battles of Alexandria and Copenhagen, does not, in
proportion to the numbers engaged, bear any comparison with that of Algeziras,
either in point of bloodiness or obstinacy.</p>

<p>The English, after having left the glory and the field of battle to the two
nations, covered with shame, and taught by dear-bought experience, have only
given an unequivocal proof of their inveterate hatred to France and Spain;
since, not being able to obtain any advantage over the French and Spanish
forces, they directed their fire against an inoffensive town, which received no
small injury in the buildings. This is the only glory which the arms of Great
Britain have to boast of.</p>

<p>The Pomp&eacute;e was towed out of the action by eight boats, who came to her succour
from the garrison of Gibraltar. She was kept afloat by casks, or otherwise could
not have been brought in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>The ships of the French Republic which sustained this attack were the
Formidable, 84, Citizen Linois; Dessaix, 74, Moncousu, killed; L'Indomptable,
84, Lalonde, killed; the frigate Muiron, 36, Martinencq; five Spanish gun-boats
damaged, and two sunk. In the French ships, three hundred and six killed; one
hundred and eighty-four wounded. We suppose in the English squadron above five
hundred are killed, and from two hundred and seventy to two hundred and eighty
wounded.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Madrid Gazette Extraordinary.</span></p>
<p class="right">Merida, 10 July 1801.</p>

<p>The general commandant of the camp at St. Roque, in a despatch of the 6th
instant, transmitted by a courier extraordinary, communicates an account of an
action which has been fought between six sail of the line, and other vessels of
war, belonging to the English, and the French squadron of three ships of the
line, and one frigate, lying at anchor in the harbour of Algeziras; and of the
glorious result which has taken place for his Majesty's arms, and those of the
Republic, his ally.</p>

<p>About eight in the morning of that day, (viz. the 6th,) there were seen, coming
out of Gibraltar, one ship of eighty-four guns, five of seventy-four, a lugger
of sixteen, another of ten, and a polacre of ten, two armed launches, and
fourteen boats. This force, under the command of a Rear-admiral, stood into
Algeziras, for the purpose of attacking the French squadron then anchored in
that port, which, as has been already stated, consisted of three sail of the
line, and one frigate. The commanders of this squadron, being aware of the
enemy's intention, made their dispositions for defence, placing themselves, as
well as they were able, under the cover of our batteries, and waiting in this
position for his approach.</p>

<p>The action commenced at nine; it was very obstinate and bloody on both sides,
and likewise on the part of our batteries, which decided the fate of the day.
The action was continued till two in the afternoon, at which hour the English
drew off with the loss of one ship of the line; taking in tow another, which was
dismasted and damaged in the hull; and having sustained very great loss and
damage in the rest of their vessels. Their loss in men must have been
considerable, as it is certain that a great number were killed and wounded on
board all the ships. The French <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>also have been equal sufferers, the killed and
wounded in their squadron being estimated at eight hundred: that of our troops
has been less; out of the whole, only the royal regiment of Ronda has lost
eleven men.</p>

<p>The fire of our batteries was so hot and well supported, that the enemy suffered
most from them; and particularly it is to that of St. Jago we owe the capture of
the English ship, for her bold man&oelig;uvre of attempting to pass between the
French Rear-admiral's ship, the Formidable, and the shore, made her take the
ground; and, notwithstanding the utmost exertion to put her afloat, it being
found impossible to move her, the fire from the battery very soon dismasted her,
and compelled her to strike. The French vessels, and our batteries, have
likewise received a good deal of damage; but they are already in a course of
repair; and the most active dispositions are making in order to cause the enemy
to repent, should he have any intention of renewing the action with troops so
animated and well-conducted as ours and the French have proved themselves in the
engagement of the 6th.</p></div>

<p>The French account of this action, as we have already noticed, was
still more exaggerated than the Spanish; and, unfortunately for the
friends and relatives of the Admiral, officers, and men of the
squadron, it made its way to England some time previously to the
<span class="italic">true</span> accounts,&mdash;causing much uneasiness. The <span class="italic">Moniteur</span> announced
that</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>On the 5th July, at eight o'clock in the morning, the cannonade commenced
against six English ships, which lost no time in coming within musket-shot of
the French vessels. The action then became very warm. These two squadrons seemed
equally animated with a determination <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>to conquer. If the French squadron had
any advantage in point of situation, the English had double their force, and
several of their vessels had ninety guns each: already had the English ship,
Hannibal, of seventy-four guns, contrived to place herself between the French
squadron and the shore. It was now eleven o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and this proved the
decisive moment. For two hours the Formidable, the French Admiral's ship,
successfully opposed three English ships.</p>

<p>One of the British squadron, which was singly engaged with a French vessel,
struck her colours at three-quarters past eleven. Immediately after, the
Hannibal, exposed to the fire of three French ships, which fired from two decks,
also struck her colours: about half-past twelve, the English squadron cut their
cables, and sailed away. The Hannibal was boarded by the Formidable. Of six
hundred men, who composed her crew, three hundred were killed. The first ship
that struck her colours was retaken by a great number of gun-boats, and other
vessels, sent out from Gibraltar. This action covers the French arms with glory,
and shows what they are capable of accomplishing. Rear-admiral Linois <span class="italic">proceeded
to Cadiz with the Hannibal, in order to repair her damage</span>.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> We wait with impatience the returns of the loss
sustained by each ship.</p></div>

<p>These accounts appear to have reached Paris on the 11th July. On the
19th, the following bulletin reached St. Malo.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Three French ships of the line and a frigate, under the command of Rear-admiral
Linois, were attacked on the 6th instant by six English sail of the line and a
frigate. The English were completely beaten, and took refuge <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>in Gibraltar,
leaving in possession of the French the Hannibal, of seventy-four guns: another
ship of the line had struck, but was towed off by a great number of gun-vessels,
which sailed from Gibraltar to her relief.</p></div>

<p>About this time, the Jason frigate, having been wrecked near St. Malo,
the captain and crew were made prisoners. The author was sent in with
a flag of truce by Commodore Cunningham, of the Clyde, to negotiate
for the exchange of prisoners; when the French officer, with an air of
triumph and exultation, handed him a copy of that bulletin: but, as
soon as the negotiation was ended, the author had the pleasure of
handing to him, in return, the Gazette account of the victory of the
13th, which Sir James Saumarez had gained over Linois, and which the
Commodore had received, fortunately, on that day. The Frenchman's
chagrin may be easily imagined, when he threw down the Gazette, with
the exclamation '<span class="italic">Ce n'est pas vrai</span>!'</p>

<p>On the statement of Linois' victory, as it was called, reaching Paris,
a handsome sword was sent to him; which, however, did not reach him
until after his subsequent defeat. On this occasion the following
Epigram was written.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="left10">In the days of the Bourbons, a man was <span class="italic">rewarded</span><br />
<span class="i2">For <span class="italic">standing</span> the brunt of the day:</span><br />
But, now, this old maxim in France is <span class="italic">discarded</span>,&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">Men are honoured for</span> <span class="italic">running away</span>!</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p><p>In the French accounts nothing was mentioned of their running their
ships aground to escape from the English, which is, indeed, the only
thing Citizen Linois deserved any credit for doing. At the same time,
it could not fail to convince both the French and Spanish troops, of
the want of confidence he must have had in his crews, and of their
evident inferiority: it was certainly a new mode of fighting, which
called forth the following lines on this improvement in naval tactics.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="left10">To mar our skill, fam'd Linois, thou hast found<br />
A certain way,&mdash;by fighting ships on <span class="italic">ground</span>;<br />
Fix deep in sand thy centre, van, and rear,<br />
Nor e'er St. Vincent, Duncan, Nelson, fear.<br />
While, o'er the main, Britannia's thunder rolls,<br />
She leaves to thee the trident of the <span class="italic">shoals</span>!</p></div>

<p>In concluding this chapter, we shall relate the following anecdote of
British heroism, derived from Captain Brenton's Naval History.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>When, in the hottest part of the action at Algeziras, the C&aelig;sar <span class="italic">broke her
sheer</span>,&mdash;that is, her situation was altered by a puff or flaw of wind so as
to change the direction of her head, and turn her round, that her guns could not
be brought to bear on her opponent,&mdash;the captain ordered the boat to be
lowered down from the stern, to convey a warp to the Audacious; but the boat was
found to be knocked to pieces by the enemy's shot. Before other means could be
resorted to, Michael Collins, a young sailor belonging to the C&aelig;sar's mizen-top,
seized the end of a lead-line, and exclaiming, "You shall soon have a warp,"
darted into the sea from the tafrail, and swam with the line to the Audacious,
where it was received, and by that means a hawser was run out which answered the
intended purpose.</p></div>

<p>The squadron being now in the Mole at Gibraltar, the wounded having
been removed to the hospital, and the necessary orders given for
refitting with all possible speed, the Admiral lost no time in turning
his attention to the situation of the captain, officers, and crew of
the unfortunate Hannibal, which had so nobly maintained the honour of
the British flag.</p>

<p>Sir Jahleel Brenton says, "He ordered me to take a flag of truce, and
wait upon the French admiral (Linois), proposing an exchange of
prisoners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> which the latter refused, alleging that it was not in his
power to establish a cartel for the purpose, until he obtained the
sanction of the Minister of the Marine at Paris, to whom he had sent
off an express, as soon as the firing had ceased, on the preceding
day; but he consented to send over on parole Captain Ferris and the
officers of the Hannibal. The object of the French Admiral was very
obvious; he concluded we wanted to replace the men who were killed,
and wounded; but he justly thought, that sending officers on parole
would be an act of harmless courtesy, from which we could reap no
immediate benefit. It will be seen that, after the second action, when
his dispatches from Algeziras could scarcely have reached Paris, (only
six days having elapsed,) he did not wait for an answer from the
Minister of Marine. But circumstances had altered; we had taken a
line-of-battle ship, and burned two first-rates; and he then wished to
get back as many of the crews as possible."</p>

<p>The following correspondence, which took place between Sir James
Saumarez and the French Admiral Linois, shows the deep interest Sir
James took in the distressing situation of the crew of the Hannibal,
of which an account was brought to him by Captain Brenton, together
with the assurance that Captain Ferris and his officers would be
liberated on parole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Rosia Bay, 8th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Solicitous as I am for the welfare of the men unfortunately wounded on board his
Majesty's ship Hannibal, and desirous to have them conveyed as speedily as
possible to this garrison, I propose to send a boat early to-morrow morning with
a flag of truce, and I trust no objection can be made to their coming by her.</p>

<p>Being informed that Captain Ferris and his officers have permission to come on
their parole, a boat will also be sent for them. I have the honour to be, sir,</p>

<p class="left50">Your most obedient and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Linois,<br />
<span class="left5">commanding the French squadron at Algeziras.</span></p></div>

<p>The boat having returned from Algeziras with Captain Ferris and his
officers, but not with the crew of the Hannibal, Sir James despatched
another boat, with the following letter to Admiral Linois:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Rosia Bay, 9th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Having received different reports, particularly from Captain Ferris, that the
men who had the misfortune of being wounded on board his Majesty's ship Hannibal
are left in the most afflicting condition, and are unprovided with every kind of
refreshment, I am impelled, from motives of humanity, to renew my application to
you that they may be permitted to come to this place by the boat now sent for
them; and that you will also permit those wounded men who are confined in the
prison, and who, I understand, are without any surgical attendance whatever, to
accompany them. I have the honour to be, sir,</p>

<p class="left50">With all possible regard, your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Rear-admiral Linois,<br />
<span class="left5">commanding the French squadron at Algeziras.</span></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>
<p>This application was, however, not attended with success; and the
sufferings of the unfortunate wounded at Algeziras were extreme, until
circumstances changed, in consequence of the second action.</p>

<p>We shall now continue the authentic and interesting communication
which Sir Jahleel Brenton has so kindly made to us:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>"The morning of the 7th July was passed in getting the C&aelig;sar secured in the
Mole, and in landing the wounded men that still remained on board; also in
stripping the ship, and in ascertaining the amount of injury she had sustained.
The main-mast was so much injured that it became necessary to take it out and
get in a new one; the fore-mast was also very badly wounded, but capable of
being fished and rendered serviceable. Every effort was made to complete our
repairs, and get again ready for sea. On the following day, Captain Ferris and
his officers, who were sent on parole, arrived. They were accompanied by Lord
Cochrane and the officers of the Speedy, sloop of war, which had been taken on
the 3rd by Linois' squadron, off Malaga."</p></div>

<p>The Admiral now prepared duplicates of his despatches for the
Admiralty, which Lieutenant Janvarin, of the <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Calp&eacute;'">Calpe,</ins>, who was taken in
the C&aelig;sar's boat, assisting the Hannibal, had been previously charged
to carry to Faro. These were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> confided to Lieutenant Hills, of the
Hannibal, who, with Captain Ferris, were embarked on board the
Plymouth lugger for England. Sir Jableel Brenton says: "On taking
leave of the Admiral, the scene was deeply interesting, and even
affecting. Sir James, after giving Captain Ferris the highest credit
for his gallant daring, to which the loss of the Hannibal was
attributed, and lamenting that their united endeavours had not been
crowned with the success they merited, added, adverting to his
despatches, 'Tell them, sir, that I feel convinced I shall soon have
an opportunity of attacking the enemy again, and that they may depend
on my availing myself of it.'"</p>

<p>On the 9th, in the afternoon, the Superb and Thames, which had
continued to watch the enemy off Cadiz, were seen coming through the
Straits under a crowd of canvass, with the signal for an enemy flying;
and they had scarcely rounded Cabrita Point before the Spanish
squadron, consisting of six sail of the line, were seen in pursuit of
them, and soon after anchored in Algeziras with the French squadron.</p>

<p>Sir James now added the following to his despatches to Lord Keith:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Gibraltar, 9th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have the honour to inform your lordship that the Superb and Thames are now
standing into the bay, with the signal for the enemy's being in sight; and I
understand from Governor O'Hara that he has information from Cadiz
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>that all the
Spanish and French ships in that port were ordered to Algeziras Bay to take the
French ships to Carthagena.</p>

<p>I hope to have all the squadron ready before this day week; and, as they cannot
possibly put to sea under a fortnight at the earliest, I hope something may join
me from your lordship before they can put to sea: but, on the event of their
sailing before such junction, I shall follow them up with all the ships with me,
and proceed off Minorca, which will be my rendezvous till I have the honour of
hearing from your lordship.</p>

<p>I am sorry to mention that the Hannibal is got off; but Captain Ferris, who has
just come over on his parole, describes her in the worst condition, as well as
the three French ships, and does not think they can be repaired under a
fortnight or three weeks at the earliest; as does Lord Cochrane, who is likewise
come over on his parole.</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honour to be<br />
<span class="i2">Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Right Hon. Lord Keith, K.B. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The public despatches being closed, Sir James wrote the following
letters, which were sent by the same conveyance; and, as they contain
his own private feelings on the occasion, they will be read with
interest:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Rosia Bay, 6th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Richard,</p>

<p>After the warm expectations my friends have always formed for my success in the
public service, they will be distressed on being informed of my having failed in
an enterprise with the squadron on three French line-of-battle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>ships at anchor
off Algeziras. I was informed by different expresses from this garrison of their
having attempted to pass the Straits for Cadiz, and having anchored at some
distance from the batteries. I made sail yesterday with the intention to attack
them, if found practicable. We got round the point of the bay at about seven
this morning, and at half-past eight the action began, and during the first
hour, promised the most favourable hopes of success; when, by a most unfortunate
circumstance, the Hannibal got aground, and at once destroyed all my
expectations, though the action was continued for nearly four hours after.</p>

<p>Every possible effort was made to rescue her from the enemy's fire; and after
repeated attempts, and a very great risk of this ship and the Audacious getting
on shore under the enemy's batteries, I was under the necessity of abandoning
the Hannibal to her fate. Although we have not succeeded in bringing off the
enemy's ships, they are, we believe, very seriously damaged. Two of them are
aground, and it is not expected they will be got off.</p>

<p class="right">Wednesday, 9th July 1801.</p>

<p>Having found a conveyance by way of Tangier, I sent you a duplicate of this. The
Superb and Thames have just made their appearance, with the signal for the enemy
being out of port. I think it is a good thing to have drawn them this way, as I
trust the first Levanter will bring us ships from the Mediterranean. Captain
Ferris goes by this opportunity, and has promised to forward this immediately to
you. He will be heard of at the Admiralty, or at the Adelphi Hotel. Great praise
is due for the brave defence of his ship.</p>

<p class="right">10th July 1801.</p>

<p>It is incalculable how much I have on my hands, night <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>and day; but, thank God!
my health is good, though my anxiety is great. A fresh Levanter having sprung
up, the lugger sails immediately. Phil. Dumaresq is very well, as are all the
others. Poor Graves is the only person we have lost of the class of officers. I
also wrote to you, by way of Lisbon, only an hour since, and just before the
easterly wind set in. I trust none of my friends will suffer anxiety on my
account. This will be addressed to you, my dear Richard, and you will forward it
to my brother. He will be happy in being able to satisfy those who have friends
on board that they have all escaped unhurt. H. Brock, with the young men from
the island, are all well. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Richard Saumarez, Esq.</p></div>

<p>Extracts of letters written on the 7th July 1801, to Lady Saumarez:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>I have formed a thousand apprehensions lest an account of the events of
yesterday should reach England through France before the arrival of my
despatches (which were sent off by way of Faro), and fill your mind with cruel
anxiety on my account; and this fear is much increased lest those despatches
should not even arrive, as I was obliged to send them by a doubtful opportunity,
through Tetuan and Tangier, the wind not admitting any vessel to pass the
Straits.</p>

<p>Trusting, however, to their safety, I will not repeat their contents; but will
only observe that, when I sat down to write to you, it was the first interval of
rest from one of the most bustling scenes I ever witnessed, and from
experiencing one of the severest disappointments I have ever <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>known; having, for
a considerable period during the action, flattered myself with the strongest
confidence that the most complete success would have attended the enterprise.</p>

<p>I resign myself to the decree of <span class="smcap">Divine Providence</span>, whose will the winds obey;
and I have great cause to be thankful for not having been forsaken in the hour
of danger, but for having my courage strengthened as the peril increased.
Feeling, as I do, all the responsibility on an event of this importance to the
country, I should be miserable had I to reproach myself for having undertaken
the enterprise on light grounds, or with having failed in the planning or in the
execution; but, on the contrary, it is admitted by every one to have been most
judicious. It is therefore only in the result that I have been unfortunate, and
that arising from unforeseen and inevitable causes. I have been too much
employed to reflect on the light in which the business may be viewed in England;
but, conscious of having done my duty, and to the utmost of my exertions, I
shall be indifferent as to the rest. I only trust that all my friends, but you
more particularly, will be superior to any reflexions that may be made, should
there be any unfavourable to me; though I hope for better things, and that with
the liberal, at least, that which has been well intended, and carried on with
conduct and bravery, will be held in some estimation.</p></div>

<p>Admiral Linois, from the specimen he had had of the determined
perseverance of the British commander-in-chief, had no wish to try
another contest; nor was it possible for him to escape the risk of
one, either by lying under the protection of the Spanish batteries, or
by proceeding to Cadiz. He lost no time, therefore, in sending an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
express to the Spanish Admiral Mazzaredo, and the French Rear-admiral
Dumanoir, who, with Commodore Le Ray and other officers and men, had
previously arrived in two frigates at Cadiz for the purpose of
equipping the Spanish fleet, imploring the assistance of a squadron to
convoy them to Cadiz, before the English ships under Sir James
Saumarez could be refitted; adding in his despatch, "I have just
received advice that the enemy intends burning us at our anchorage. It
is in your power to save for the Republic three fine ships of the line
and a frigate by merely ordering the Spanish squadron to come and seek
us."</p>

<p>This demand, through the influence of Admiral Dumanoir, was
immediately acceded to by Mazzaredo, who ordered Vice-admiral Moreno
to proceed with five sail of the line, three frigates, and a lugger,
accompanied by the San Antonio, manned partly with French and
Spaniards, in which Admiral Dumanoir hoisted his flag. The movements
of these ships were observed by Captain Keats in the Superb, who, in
consequence of information he had received from an American, returned
with the Thames and Pasley off Cadiz.</p>

<p>At daylight, on the 9th, this squadron put to sea, except the San
Antonio, which, being unable to fetch out, came to an anchor in the
road. The rest made sail up the Straits, preceded by the Superb,
Thames, and Pasley; and, the wind being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span> fair, the former reached
Algeziras about four <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, while the latter, as already stated,
anchored in Gibraltar Bay, to unite their efforts in refitting the
shattered ships. On the next morning, the San Antonio, with Admiral
Dumanoir's flag, arrived at Algeziras.</p>

<p>As the object of this overwhelming force could be no other than to
conduct in safety the three French ships, and their prize the
Hannibal, to Cadiz or Carthagena, the exertions of the British
officers and men were redoubled in getting the damaged ships ready to
meet the enemy. They accomplished what has been justly acknowledged,
one of the most extraordinary undertakings ever known.</p>

<p>The Pomp&eacute;e was in too bad a state to leave any hopes that she could be
got ready in time; her men, therefore, were distributed to assist in
repairing the other ships: and all idea of refitting the C&aelig;sar was on
the point of being abandoned!</p>

<p>The following account given by Captain Brenton will be read with much
interest: "Sir James now expressed the greatest anxiety to have as
many of his little squadron as possible ready for action, that he
might avail himself at any moment of the motions of the enemy to make
an attack upon some part of them; and despairing, from the state of
the C&aelig;sar, that she could possibly be got in readiness before the
departure of the ships from Algeziras, he expressed a wish that the
deficiencies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> in the other ships might be made up from the crew of the
C&aelig;sar; but on my entreaty for permission to keep them while a
possibility remained of getting her in a state to receive his flag
again, he consented, hoisting it for the time on board the Audacious.</p>

<p>"On communicating to the people what had passed, there was a universal
cry, 'All hands all night and all day until the ship is ready!' so
earnest were they to carry the flag of their beloved Admiral again
into battle, and so sanguine in the expectation of victory,
notwithstanding the disparity of force,&mdash;nearly <span class="italic">two to one</span>! This I
could not consent to, as they would have been worn out and incapable
of further exertion; but I directed that all hands should be employed
during the day, and that they should work <span class="italic">watch and watch</span> during the
night. They immediately commenced their various duties, with all the
energy and zeal that could be expected from men under such powerful
causes of excitement. The new main-mast was got in forthwith, and
extraordinary efforts made to refit the rigging.</p>

<p>"On Saturday, the 11th, the enemy showed symptoms of moving; and the
Admiral, fearing they might get out in the night, again suggested that
the people from the C&aelig;sar should be distributed, and every idea of
getting her ready abandoned; but I entreated, and obtained permission
to keep them during that night, under the promise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> that they should be
held in readiness at a minute's warning to proceed to the ship pointed
out to receive them.</p>

<p>"The enemy having anchored again, the Admiral went to dine with the
governor; and, on his return on board, was greatly delighted at
beholding the ship apparently ready for sea, although much yet
remained to be done."</p>

<p>We must here pay a just tribute to the professional abilities and
conduct of Captain (now Sir Jahleel) Brenton. He was, in the first
place, well aware of the magnitude of the labour which the men had to
perform, and saw the danger of allowing his brave crew to be worn out
with fatigue in attempting that to which the human frame is unequal.
He therefore decided that, instead of working on until the labour was
finished, according to the seamen's laudable wishes, they should have
such a portion of rest as would enable them to resume their labour
with renewed energy. In the second place, he knew that without system,
the exertions of the men would be in vain; but the admirable
directions he gave employed every man in what he was best able to
perform without impeding his neighbour, whilst every part of the
labour advanced simultaneously. There has, indeed, never yet been on
record an instance of a ship performing such a task so well and in so
short a time.</p>

<p>Although the services going on required many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> men to be on shore for
gunpowder and other stores, to replace what had been expended, there
was not a single complaint of any one absenting himself from his duty,
or of being intoxicated; though the inducement must have been great,
from the number of wine-houses on the Rock: but such was the desire of
these brave fellows to be avenged for the loss of the Hannibal, that
they would not allow any temptation to induce them to swerve from the
duty they had to perform.</p>

<p>The extraordinary anxiety of mind, and the multiplicity of duty he had
to perform, did not divert the attention of Sir James from the
situation of the unfortunate crew of the Hannibal, especially the
wounded, who were suffering as well from want of proper surgical care
as from the treatment they had received. He once more made a strong,
but fruitless attempt for their exchange, by addressing the following
letter to Admiral Linois:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Rosia Bay, 10th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I am impelled by motives of humanity again to renew my application in behalf of
the men unfortunately wounded on board his Britannic Majesty's ship Hannibal,
and to request they may be permitted to come to this garrison without delay. A
proposition so conformable to the laws of civilised nations I trust cannot be
rejected; but, should you further refuse to comply with it, you must take upon
yourself the impression all the world must have of so cruel a proceeding as to
deny those unhappy people the benefit <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>of their own hospital, where they would
receive surgical assistance, and not be subjected to the severe treatment they
have so long experienced in their present situation.</p>

<p class="left50">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i2">Your most obedient humble servant,</span></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>Rear-admiral Linois, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>No answer having been given to this application, the correspondence
ended, to be resumed under more favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>Sir James now added to the duplicates of his despatches (which had
been sent in charge of Lieutenant Janvarin, by way of Tangier,) the
following letter to his brother:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="left65"></p>
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Gibraltar, 10th July 1801.</p>

<p>You will, I hope, receive the letters I have written to you on the subject of
the enterprise of our squadron against three ships of the line and a frigate, at
anchor in Algeziras Bay, last Monday; for a more particular account of which I
must refer you to my public letter. But as my friends, with their usual anxiety
on my account, will naturally wish further information from me, I must assure
them in justice to myself and for their satisfaction, that everything was done
that depended on myself, both in the planning and executing the business; but I
cannot be accountable for the accidents that prevented its success. Even within
an hour from our first engaging, and before any of our ships had sustained much
injury, the Pomp&eacute;e, which was remarkably well placed against the inner ship,
which proved to be the French Admiral, had at one time nearly silenced her, and
must have done so in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>less than ten minutes, had not an unfortunate flaw of wind
<span class="italic">broke her sheer</span>; and from that moment she was unable to bring one of her guns to
bear on the enemy's ship.</p>

<p>A short time after, the Hannibal got a fine breeze of wind, and was lying up in
the handsomest manner for the French ship; but unfortunately, wishing to go
between her and the shore, got aground. Surely in either of these instances I
was not concerned.</p>

<p>I had, before this, cut our cables, to profit by a favourable breeze to close
the other two ships; but before we got near them it failed us, as well as the
Audacious, and with the current we drove close to the island battery, where we
remained a considerable time before either of the ships could clear a shoal
close to it. At length a fine breeze sprung up, which gave the most favourable
hope of carrying us close to the enemy's ships, and, by silencing them, to
extricate the unfortunate Hannibal.</p>

<p>But here, again, it most unhappily failed us; and although we had, at different
times, opened a heavy fire upon them, we were still not sufficiently near to
silence them effectually; and, the wind all the time leading us farther off, I
was constrained to abandon all hopes of success, and proceeded with the squadron
to this anchorage.</p>

<p>The Superb yesterday joined us, with the Thames. Captain Keats, having seen the
enemy coming out of Cadiz, appeared with the signal of their being in sight, and
they soon after came round Cabrita Point. Two are three-deckers, and three are
seventy-fours, with three frigates. If it draws this force to the Mediterranean,
some good may come from it. A squadron is hourly expected from Lord Keith, and
probably some ships may soon join us from England. We shall have all the ships
in readiness; and the junction of a few ships, would make us again superior to
the enemy's force. I must not forget to mention <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>that Captain Brenton has shown
himself a brave and most able officer.</p>

<p>It is with difficulty I have found a leisure moment to write this. All I request
of my friends is, to feel assured that the failure of this enterprise has in no
instance proceeded from myself; and every one is ready to acknowledge that I
did, in every respect, all that depended on me. This, you will perceive, is
written in the midst of much bustle and a most active scene.</p></div>

<p>The despatches contained accounts of the arrival of the Spanish
squadron, and of Sir James's determination to attack them if they
attempted to put to sea, even with the force under his command. He
also sent despatches to Lisbon to delay any convoys which might be
sailing; and to Lord Keith, in the Mediterranean, to inform his
lordship of all the circumstances we have related. The Plymouth lugger
had already sailed, the wind being fair, with Captain Ferris, who, as
well as Lieutenant Hills, were bearers of the interesting details.</p>

<p>The intense interest which these circumstances created on the Rock of
Gibraltar is far beyond description; nor do we know whether the kind
and sympathising reception which the suffering heroes met with on
their return from Algeziras was more worthy of praise than the
unparalleled exertions made to renew the conflict. On the one hand,
had the squadron arrived after the most complete and glorious victory,
they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> not have been received in a manner more gratifying to
their feelings; while, on the other hand, it was evident that every
man was worthy of such generous and such noble conduct.</p>

<p>The attention of the governor, the garrison, and the inhabitants,
although themselves in a state of privation, was unremitting. We shall
leave them for the present preparing to take farewell of each other on
the evening before the Admiral's departure, to meet what must have
appeared to every spectator an overwhelming foe!</p>

<p>General O'Hara the gallant governor, and the brave garrison of
Gibraltar, had beheld from the Rock, which is only four miles from
Algeziras, the long-contested, severe, but unfortunate conflict of the
6th of July. They had witnessed the bravery of their countrymen. Their
intense anxiety for the success of the Admiral's daring attack had
been changed into sympathy for the loss his squadron had sustained;
and, fully convinced that not only no honour had been sacrificed, but
that the character of the nation had been gloriously maintained, the
unsuccessful were received at the Rock, as if they had returned from a
victory. The garrison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> beheld with admiration the wonderful efforts
which were made to meet a still more formidable foe. Every day marked
the progress of the Herculean labours in preparation for that event;
the exertions, zeal, and intrepidity of Sir James's officers and crews
increased in proportion to the multiplied force of the enemy, which,
to men of any other cast, would have appeared overwhelming!</p>

<p>After one of the severest engagements on record, the British squadron,
in the short space of five days, had repaired its damages, and sought
the enemy, whose force had been nearly tripled by the junction of six
ships and three frigates from Cadiz. With such men, and in such a
cause, victory seemed certain, notwithstanding the great disparity of
force between the belligerents, and the exertions of the enemy proved,
that he expected a tremendous struggle. Every circumstance contributed
to render the approaching contest more eventful. Their late
unsuccessful attack only served to animate the officers and crews with
a noble enthusiasm, and a desire to put their valour to another but a
fairer trial; and they well knew that their Admiral would lead them to
the combat with that consummate skill, and deliberate courage which
had so justly rendered his name illustrious.</p>

<p>At length the moment arrived. The enemy, whose force almost tripled
that of the English, were seen under sail; the wind was fair, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
weather fine. The C&aelig;sar, having rehoisted the Admiral's flag, made the
signal to prepare for battle!</p>

<p>For a description of the intensely interesting and animating scene
which followed, we gladly avail ourselves of a communication kindly
made to us by Sir Jahleel Brenton, the gallant captain of the C&aelig;sar on
that memorable occasion.</p>

<p>"12th July 1801.&mdash;At daylight the enemy were seen making every
preparation for sailing; and in the course of the forenoon were
getting under way, and working out of the bay with a fresh wind from
the eastward. As they required to make several tacks for this purpose,
it was past one o'clock before the headmost ships could clear Cabrita
Point, when they brought to, to wait for the others to join them.</p>

<p>"At half-past two the C&aelig;sar hauled out of the Mole, her band playing
"Cheer up my lads, 'tis to glory we steer!" which was answered by the
military band on the Mole-head with "Britons, strike home!" At the
same moment the Admiral's flag was rehoisted on board the C&aelig;sar; and
sail being made upon her, she weighed amidst the deafening cheers and
acclamations of the garrison, and the whole assembled population,
carrying with her the sincerest and most ardent wishes for victory.</p>

<p>"She took her station off Europa Point, with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>the signals for her
little squadron to close round her, and to prepare for battle.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> We
then returned the salute which had been fired by the garrison on
entering the bay on the 6th; and which, in consequence of being
immediately engaged with the enemy, we could not do at the time. It
was delightful during this and the preceding days to witness the calm,
but decided manner of the admiral. He had evidently calculated the
awful responsibility under which he was placed; and this, at the same
time, was self-imposed; for it was by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>no means incumbent on him as a
duty, with only five sail of the line, viz. the C&aelig;sar, Superb,
Spencer, Venerable, and Audacious, to attack an enemy with six fresh
ships, of which number two mounted one hundred and twelve guns each,
one of ninety, and three of seventy-four, in addition to the three
French ships we had already engaged, and their prize, the Hannibal.
But our chief had counted the cost, and made up his mind to the
enterprise. His intention was to throw his whole force upon whatever
part of the enemy's line he might be able to reach; depending upon the
talents of his captains, and the discipline of his ships, to make up
for the disparity of force, especially in a night action.</p>

<p>"The squadron was soon assembled off Europa, and we beheld that of the enemy
forming their line off Cabrita, about five miles to leeward, waiting for the
Hannibal, which was the last ship to leave Algeziras. Sir James now made the
interrogatory signal to know if all the ships were ready for battle, which was
most properly answered in the negative, as all had much to do. The time which
the combined squadron took to get into the order of battle and sailing was
invaluable to all of us, by enabling us to complete the arrangements so
necessary upon so momentous an occasion. At length, every ship having announced
her readiness for action, the Admiral made the signal for them to be prepared to
follow <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>his motions. He had already communicated with his captains his plan of
attack, and no other signal was made, or was necessary.</p>

<p>"<span class="italic">At eight o'clock</span> the Hannibal, unable to work out of the Bay, was observed to
anchor again at Algeziras, and the enemy bore up through the Straits; the
C&aelig;sar's helm was instantly put up, a blue light being burned at the same time
for the squadron to follow. At 8h.40m. the Superb was gaining fast upon us, and
the Admiral ordered me to hail Captain Keats, directing him to engage the ship
nearest to the Spanish shore. The enemy was retreating in two lines abreast,
thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/412.jpg" width="400" height="243"
alt="diagram4" title="" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>the three French ships in the van, the Spanish squadron in the rear. Had the
Hannibal succeeded in getting out of the bay, she was to have taken the station
ahead of the French ships, at the place marked with a cross H, in order to put
her in the greatest security, and to preserve their trophy.</p>

<p>"At five minutes past eleven the Superb opened her fire; and, very shortly
after, the two sternmost ships of the enemy were seen to be in flames. We were
rapidly approaching them, and orders had been sent down to the officers at their
quarters to fire as soon as the guns would bear.</p>

<p>"I was at this time standing on the poop ladder, near the Admiral, when he
seized me by the shoulder, and, pointing to the flames bursting out, exclaimed,
'My God, sir, look there! the day is ours!' A more magnificent scene never
presented itself, as may be easily imagined, than two ships of such immense
magnitude as the Spanish first-rates, on board of each other in flames, with a
fresh gale, the sea running high, and their sails in the utmost confusion. The
flames, ascending the rigging with the rapidity of lightning, soon communicated
to the canvass, which instantly became one sheet of fire. A very general feeling
of regret and sympathy seemed to be quickly experienced around us when we beheld
the Spanish colours brilliantly illuminated by the dreadful conflagration,
instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> of the French. The unfortunate Spaniards, having become at once the
tools and the victims of France, were objects of our sincere commiseration.</p>

<p>"The Superb was now seen a little way on the starboard bow, engaged with one of
the enemy's ships, while several others were in sight at a distance ahead. We
kept on our course, and after having fired a broadside into the Superb's
opponent, (which, however, was already nearly silenced), continued the chase,
followed by the Venerable; but, when nearly the length of Trafalgar, our wounded
masts complained so much, that we were under the necessity of close-reefing the
main-top-sail, and taking in the fore-top-sail. The Admiral was also anxious to
get his squadron round him, that he might, with his collected force, reach Cadiz
before the morning, and cut the enemy off from the only port in which they could
find security.</p>

<p>"The easterly wind, which, although blowing with great violence in the Straits,
is seldom felt close in shore on either the Spanish or African coasts, entirely
failed us as we hauled round Cape Trafalgar, and left our ship rolling heavily
in the swell, to the great danger of our masts. At half-past twelve o'clock one
of the Spanish three-deckers blew up, with a tremendous explosion, and soon
after the other. They had previously separated, after their masts had fallen,
and the rigging was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>consumed; and they were seen for some time burning at a
distance from each other, before their fatal termination.</p>

<p>"As the Admiral and myself were looking over the chart together, in order to
shape our course for Cadiz, we heard an alarming cry of 'Fire!' and, running out
upon deck, were enveloped in a thick sulphrueous smoke, which seemed to pervade
every part of the ship. Soon, however, we found it clear away, and ascertained
the cause to be, that we had run into the column of smoke and vapour arising
from the explosion of the Spanish ship, which, being too dense to rise, lay
along the surface of the water. We gradually emerged from this, and were
relieved from our apprehensions of sharing the fate of our unhappy enemies.</p>

<p>"At the dawn of day we saw the Venerable close to a French line-of-battle ship,
and drawing up with her by the aid of a light air off the Spanish shore. At five
o'clock the Venerable opened her fire upon the enemy. The breeze dying away, the
two ships were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The C&aelig;sar, at the distance of
about a mile and a half, was perfectly becalmed. The boats were sent ahead, in
hopes of being able to tow her within gun-shot of the enemy. In the course of a
short time, a light breeze having dispersed the dense cloud of smoke which the
fire of the two ships had occasioned, we discovered the Venerable with her
main-mast gone, and her <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>opponent availing herself of the air from the eastward
to draw away, and pursue her course for Cadiz, firing her stern-chasers at the
Venerable. The remainder of the enemy's squadron, consisting of five sail of the
line and one frigate, in which both the French and Spanish admirals were
embarked, were discerned in the N.W., at a considerable distance, coming down
with a westerly wind.</p>

<p>"The Superb having secured the prize, was approaching us from the S.E., and the
Spencer and Audacious were also to the southward. Such was the relative
situation of the squadrons, when, at eight minutes past eight, the Venerable
made the signal of having struck on a shoal. The Admiral, very apprehensive of
her falling into the hands of the enemy, sent me with discretional orders to
Captain Hood, that, should he not be able to get her off the shoal, he might put
his men into the Thames, and burn the Venerable, making the signal at the same
time for the Thames to close with the Venerable as soon as possible. I had
scarcely left the C&aelig;sar when I saw the Venerable's fore-mast go over the side;
and before I reached her the mizen-mast followed. I found her, on going on
board, a perfect wreck, striking on the shoal, and the shot from the stern-chase
guns of the Formidable, her opponent, going over her. The gallant Hood was
seated on a gun on the quarter-deck, cheerfully waiting for the assistance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>which he knew the Admiral would send to him as soon as the wind would enable
him, and ready to take advantage of any circumstance that might occur.</p>

<p>"Having delivered my message from the Admiral, he said, 'Tell Sir James I hope
it is not yet so bad with the old Venerable; I hope to get her off soon. Let the
Thames stay by me, in readiness to receive our people. These rascals shall not
have her.' I returned to my ship; the breeze sprung up; and the Thames closing
with the Venerable, enabled her to heave off the shoal, and the enemy availed
himself of the wind to get into Cadiz. The Venerable was soon under jury-masts
and in tow of the Spencer, steering for Gibraltar, followed by the rest of the
squadron; where we all anchored, with our prize, the San Antonio, of
seventy-four guns, at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on the 14th.</p>

<p>"The scene before us, on anchoring, was of the most animating description. Every
point of the Rock overhanging the shore was crowded with people, and the
acclamations of the troops and inhabitants which rent the air resounded
throughout the bay! Here, indeed, was a triumph for our hero, who, only a week
before, had been towed in from Algeziras with his crippled and defeated
squadron, with the loss of a ship of the line; but now entering victorious with
the same squadron, reinforced, it is true, by the Superb, but diminished by the
loss of the Hannibal, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> the disabled state of the Pomp&eacute;e had prevented her
leaving Gibraltar; after having engaged and defeated an enemy of more than
double his force, and having burnt two of their first-rates, and taken from them
a ship of the line.</p>

<p>"From the nature of the attack and retreat, there was not much hard fighting on
this occasion, and consequently little opportunity for any display of that
valour and skill which is so constantly manifested in severe actions. The Superb
and Venerable had the greatest, and almost the only share. But the conduct of
the Admiral, I will venture to say, when all the circumstances are taken into
consideration, must be deemed fully equal to anything that has adorned the pages
of England's naval history. Instead of the recklessness of despair, to which
some might have attributed an attack with crippled ships against a force every
way so greatly superior, he manifested a calm and resolute determination. His
intentions were expressed with so much clearness that, as I have already
observed, signals were rendered unnecessary. He waited with much patience and
firmness for the enemy to bear up, which would place them in a situation the
least favourable for resisting a simultaneous attack upon any portion of their
squadron.</p>

<p>"When the governor, the garrison, and the inhabitants of Gibraltar, who had
passed the night with painful anxiety beheld the approach of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>victorious
squadron, their joy and exultation knew no bounds. Even the wounded at the
hospitals, when they heard of the glorious success which had attended their
brethren in arms, raising their stumps, joined in the general burst of
acclamation. On the arrival of the C&aelig;sar, the royal standard was hoisted,
twenty-one guns were fired at the King's Bastion, and the whole of this noble
fortress was brilliantly illuminated in honour of the victory."</p>

<p>After the termination of this contest,&mdash;a contest which may be said to have
lasted seven days, in which two battles had been fought under peculiar
disadvantages, and which ended in adding another brilliant ray to the naval
glory of Britain,&mdash;Sir James, with that humility which had ever formed a
distinguished feature in his character, returned thanks to the great Giver of
all victory for crowning his exertions with success.</p>

<p>The following general memorandum was given out to the squadron, on their return
to Gibraltar:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Rosia Bay, 15th July 1801.</p>

<p>Rear-admiral Sir James Saumarez has the happiness to offer his most heartfelt
congratulations to the captains, officers, and men of the ships he had the
honour to command, on the signal success with which it has pleased Almighty God
to crown their zealous exertions in the service of their country. To the
discipline and valour of British seamen is to be ascribed their great
superiority over the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>enemy, who, although more than triple the force of the
English squadron in number of guns and weight of metal, have been so signally
defeated.</p>

<p>The Rear-admiral has not failed to transmit in his late despatches a report of
the unparalleled exertions of all the officers and men in refitting his
Majesty's ships after the battle of Algeziras, where their conduct and bravery
were equally conspicuous, and which has led to the late glorious success.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To the respective Captains, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Dumaresq, of the C&aelig;sar, was now despatched in the Louisa
brig to England, with the following official accounts of the action
from the Rear-admiral, and from Captains Keats and Hood:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Cape Trafalgar, 13th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I request you will please to inform my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty that
it has pleased the Almighty to crown the exertions of this squadron with the
most signal success over the enemies of their country.</p>

<p>The three French line-of-battle ships disabled in the action of the 6th instant
off Algeziras, were, on the 8th, reinforced by a squadron of five Spanish
line-of-battle ships, under the command of Don Juan Joaquin de Moreno, and a
French ship of seventy-four guns, wearing a broad pendant; besides three
frigates, and an incredible number of gun-boats and other vessels; and got under
sail yesterday morning, together with his Majesty's late ship Hannibal, which
they had succeeded in getting off the shoal on which she struck.</p>

<p>I almost despaired of having a sufficient force in readiness to oppose to such
numbers; but, through the great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>exertions of Captain Brenton, and the officers
and men belonging to the C&aelig;sar, the ship was in readiness to warp out of the
Mole yesterday morning, and got under way immediately after, with all the
squadron except the Pomp&eacute;e, which ship had not had time to get her masts in.</p>

<p>Confiding in the zeal and intrepidity of the officers and men I had the
happiness to serve with, I determined, if possible, to obstruct the passage of
this powerful force to Cadiz. Late in the evening I observed the enemy's ships
to have cleared Cabrita Point; and, at eight, I bore up with the squadron to
stand after them. His Majesty's ship Superb being stationed ahead of the C&aelig;sar,
I directed Captain Keats to make sail and attack the sternmost ships of the
enemy's rear, using his endeavours to keep in-shore of them.</p>

<p>At eleven, the Superb opened her fire close to the enemy's ships; and, on the
C&aelig;sar's coming up and preparing to engage a three-decker that had hauled her
wind, she was perceived to have taken fire; and the flames having communicated
to a ship to leeward of her, both were soon in a blaze, and presented a most
awful sight. As no possibility existed of affording the least assistance in so
distressing a situation, the C&aelig;sar passed, to close with the ship engaged by the
Superb; but, by the cool and determined fire kept up on her, which must ever
reflect the highest credit on the discipline of that ship, she was completely
silenced, and soon after hauled down her colours.</p>

<p>The Venerable and Spencer having at this time come up, I bore up after the
enemy, who were carrying a press of sail, standing out of the Straits; and lost
sight of them. During the night it blew excessively hard till daylight, and, in
the morning, the only ships in company were the Venerable and Thames, ahead of
the C&aelig;sar, and one of the French ships at some distance from them, standing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>towards the shoals of Conil, besides the Spencer astern, coming up.</p>

<p>All the ships immediately made sail with a fresh breeze, but, as we approached,
the wind suddenly failing, the Venerable was alone able to bring her to action;
which Captain Hood did in the most gallant manner, and had nearly silenced the
French ship, when his main-mast (which had been before wounded) was
unfortunately shot away, and, it coming nearly calm, the enemy's ship was
enabled to get off without any possibility of following her. The highest praise
is due to Captain Hood, the officers, and men of the Venerable, for their spirit
and gallantry in this action, which entitled them to better success. The French
ship was an eighty-four, with additional guns on the gunwale. This action was so
near the shore that the Venerable struck on one of the shoals; but was soon
after got off, and taken in tow by the Thames, though with the loss of all her
masts.</p>

<p>The enemy's ships are now in sight to the westward, standing in for Cadiz; the
Superb and Audacious, with the captured ship, are in sight, with the Carlotta,
Portuguese frigate, commanded by Captain Crawford Duncan, who very handsomely
came out with the squadron, and has been of the greatest assistance to Captain
Keats in staying by the enemy's ship captured by the Superb.</p>

<p>I am proceeding with the squadron for Rosia Bay, and shall proceed, the moment
all the ships are refitted, to resume my station before Cadiz; and shall
immediately detach the Thames to cruise off Cape St. Mary's.</p>

<p>No praises that I can bestow are adequate to the merits of the officers and
ships' companies of all the squadron, particularly for their unremitted
exertions in refitting the ships at Gibraltar; to which, in a great degree, is
to be ascribed the success of the squadron against the enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the Spencer and Audacious had not the good fortune to partake of this
action, I have no doubt of their exertion, had they come up in time to close
with the enemy's ships.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to Captain Holles of the Thames, and to the Honourable
Captain Dundas of the Calpe, whose assistance was particularly useful to Captain
Keats in securing the enemy's ship, and enabling the Superb to stand after the
squadron in case of being enabled to renew the action with the enemy.</p>

<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Cape Trafalgar, 14th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>I herewith enclose, for their lordships' further information, the statement I
have received from Captain Keats, to whom the greatest praise is due for his
gallant conduct in the service alluded to. Captain Hood's merits are held in too
high estimation to receive additional lustre from any praise I can bestow; but I
only do justice to my feelings, when I observe that in no instance have I known
superior bravery to that displayed by him on this occasion.</p>

<p class="left55">I have the honour to be, sir,<br />

<p>To Evan Nepean, Esq. Admiralty.</p>

<hr class="p2 c15" />
<p class="right">Superb, off Cape Trafalgar, 13th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>Pursuant to your directions to state the particulars of the Superb's services
last night, I have the honour to inform <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>you that, in consequence of your
directions to make sail up to, and engage, the sternmost of the enemy's ships,
at half-past eleven I found myself abreast of a Spanish three-deck ship, (the
Real Carlos, as appears by the report of some survivors,) which, having been
brought with two other ships, in nearly line abreast, I opened my fire upon them
at not more than three cables' lengths. This evidently produced a good effect,
as well in this ship as the others abreast of her, which soon began firing at
each other, and, at times, on the Superb. In about a quarter of an hour, I
perceived the ship I was engaging, and which had lost her fore-top-mast, to be
on fire; upon which we ceased to molest her; and I proceeded on to the ship next
at hand, which proved to be the San Antonio, of seventy-four guns and seven
hundred and thirty men, commanded by Chef-de-division Le Ray, under French
colours, wearing a broad pendant, and manned, nearly equally, with seven hundred
and thirty French and Spanish seamen, and which, after some action, (the chef
being wounded,) struck her colours.</p>

<p>I learn, from the very few survivors of the ships that caught fire and blew up,
who, in an open boat, reached the Superb at the time she was taking possession
of the San Antonio, that, in the confusion of the action, the Hermenegildo, (a
first-rate ship,) mistaking the Real Carlos for an enemy, ran on board of her,
and shared her melancholy fate. Services of this nature cannot well be expected
to be performed without some loss; but though we have to lament that Lieutenant
Edward Waller, and fourteen seamen and marines, have been mostly severely
wounded, still there is reason to rejoice that that is the extent of our loss. I
received able and active assistance from Mr. Samuel Jackson, the first
lieutenant; and it is my duty to represent to you that the officers of all
descriptions, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>seamen and marines, conducted themselves with the greatest
steadiness and gallantry.</p>

<p class="left55">I have the honour to be, sir,<br />

<p>The Rear-admiral had his flag on board the C&aelig;sar, 84.</p>

<p>The guns of the enemy's ships being much heavier, increased their
weight of metal to triple that of the squadron.</p>

<p>The Superb had Lieutenant Waller, and fourteen seamen and marines,
wounded. The Venerable had Mr. J. Williams (her master), fifteen
seamen, and two marines, killed; Lieutenant Thomas Church, Mr. Snell
(boatswain), Messrs. Massey and Pardoe (midshipmen), seventy-three
seamen, and ten marines, wounded.</p>

<p>In the French and Spanish accounts of this action, which will be given
hereafter, it will be seen that the loss of the enemy has <span class="italic">not</span> been
accurately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> enumerated; but, out of two thousand men that were in the
Real Carlos and Hermenegildo, only three hundred were saved. Commodore
Le Ray, of the San Antonio, was wounded; but his loss in men, which
must have been severe, has not been ascertained.</p>

<p>We shall here give some interesting extracts from private letters from
Sir James, written at the close of the battle:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, 13th July 1801, 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>I shall leave you to judge of the difference of my feelings to those when I sat
down to write the letter of this day week.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> To an all-merciful <span class="smcap">Providence</span> is to be ascribed the wonderful
and most awful event of last night, which will ever be remembered with terror by
the nations it concerned, and by me with infinite gratitude for so peculiar a
token of Divine mercy vouchsafed towards me.</p>

<p>Two days after the action of last Monday, a strong squadron was sent to
Algeziras from Cadiz, to protect the disabled French ships, and to convoy them
to the latter port, with the Hannibal, which ship they had succeeded in getting
off the shoal whereon she had unfortunately grounded. It may be supposed that no
exertion was wanting on my part to get the squadron in a state for service; and,
beyond all expectation, owing to the great activity and zeal of every officer
and man in the squadron, we were in a state to put to sea yesterday, on the
enemy's getting under sail from the Bay of Algeziras; the Pomp&eacute;e excepted, which
had not sufficient time to get in new masts.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I observed that the enemy's ships, consisting of ten sail of
the line and four frigates, had succeeded in clearing the bay; and at eight
o'clock I made sail <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>after them. Captain Keats, who, in the Superb, had been
much mortified at not having shared in the former affair, being near the C&aelig;sar,
I directed him to endeavour to bring the rear ships of the enemy to action;
myself following with the Venerable, and the other two ships, some distance
astern.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when the Superb succeeded in engaging the enemy; and, as we
came up, a three-deck ship hauling up for us after having fired at the Superb,
by some accident, in the moment we were going to give her our broadside, took
fire, which communicating to a ship which we perceived close to her, both were
almost instantly in a blaze. So awful a scene I never yet have witnessed. We
then closed with the Superb, which had nearly silenced her opponent, when she
struck.</p>

<p>Think what a change then took place in the inequality of force with which we
began the action! I left the Superb to take care of the prize, and proceeded
after the other ships; the Audacious and Spencer having now joined. It came on
to blow excessively hard till daylight, when I found the Venerable and Thames a
small distance ahead, and one of the French ships standing for the shore. We
immediately crowded all sail, and made sure of taking her, when the wind failed
us, and the Venerable only was able to engage her; but, being at the time close
to the shore, she very unfortunately got aground, and we were obliged to leave
her, after sustaining very great damage.</p>

<p>We are now about seven leagues from Cadiz, and I see the remainder of the
enemy's squadron going into port. I am as yet ignorant of the ship's name that
struck her colours last night. She is, however, one of those that came from
Cadiz with the Spanish squadron, but under French colours, and had a broad
pendant. We are proceeding to Gibraltar.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
The following extract is from a letter to Richard Saumarez, Esq.:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, off Cadiz, 13th July 1801.</p>

<p>I intend to send Phil. D. with my despatches. You must refer to him for the
particulars of the wonderful events since yesterday.</p></div>

<p>After detailing these events exactly as in the above, he adds,
respecting the Venerable:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>It was as severe an action as I have known, and must reflect the highest credit
on Captain Hood; but having his main-mast shot away, and it falling nearly calm,
he was obliged to leave the enemy. We were at this time close to the shoals off
the coast, on which the Venerable got aground; but she was afterwards got off,
and was taken in tow by the Thames. I fear she has sustained great loss in men.
What a surprising change, my dear Richard, to the events of last Monday! To the
Divine mercy I entirely ascribe this signal success, who never forsakes those
who place their confidence in him! I mean to send the Louisa, which joined me
yesterday from Minorca, with Phil. Dumaresq, and doubt not but he will be a
welcome messenger. We see the remainder of the enemy's squadron. They are
standing for Cadiz, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Sir James subsequently wrote to his eldest brother, residing in
Guernsey; and, as his letter will be found to contain additional
matter of much interest, we herewith insert it.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">C&aelig;sar, Gibraltar, 16th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Brother,</p>

<p>I hope that the several letters I have had the pleasure of writing to you at
different opportunities, will arrive <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>safely; and that you and all my friends
will not be kept in suspense on events which, thanks to the Divine Providence!
have terminated so successfully to the squadron. Although I always trusted some
favourable turn would take place, I never could have formed any hopes equal to
what has actually occurred. The possession of one or two of the disabled ships,
besides the recovery of the Hannibal, was the utmost that could have been
expected; but our present success far exceeds that. The destruction of two
first-rates, and the capture of a seventy-four, completely cripples the force in
Cadiz, and places the squadron with me superior to all the force the enemy can
collect; and this, without any loss whatever to this ship, and trifling to the
Superb. The men, wounded on board the latter, suffered from the explosion of
cartridges in their own ship.</p>

<p>The misfortune to the Venerable was more serious; but this was subsequently to
the attack on the enemy's force, and was mainly attributable to the untoward
circumstance of the wind failing this ship when we were very close to her.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable the <span class="italic">&eacute;clat</span> with which we have been received by this garrison,
and the distinguished honours paid to the squadron; indeed their marked
attention, after the attack of Algeziras, does them great credit; as, after the
failure of that business, we exposed Gibraltar to all the inconvenience of a
blockaded port; and yet the whole garrison received us as if we had obtained a
victory. You must suppose my distress must have been great during the interval:
convoys long expected were liable to fall into the enemy's hands, whilst the
increasing force at Cadiz would soon have put it out of my power to cope with
them.</p>

<p>The St. Antoine has scarcely suffered: my intention is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>to take her into the
service; and in two weeks, I expect, she will be partly manned, and fit for sea.
Yesterday, almost all the Hannibal's men were sent in, which will make up our
deficiencies, and partly man that ship, when in a fortnight she shall proceed on
a particular service.</p>

<p>These are trifling advantages compared to those that result from both actions.
The three ships were to have proceeded direct to the Bay of Casquays, at the
entrance of the Tagus, where the troops with them were to have taken possession
of the batteries, which would have given them complete possession of the trade
to and from Lisbon. I have despatched the Spencer and Audacious, and shall join
them with this ship, the Pomp&eacute;e, and Superb, the first easterly wind, and cruise
before Cadiz with this force, far superior to any the enemy can put to sea. I
shall soon be joined by ships from England.</p>

<p>We have, as yet, no accounts since we sailed. You will have the pleasure of
mentioning to the relations of the young men I have, that they have all behaved
most nobly, and are perfectly well: it is a particular circumstance that, out of
six ships, three masters should have been killed, and not one lieutenant hurt
out of the whole number.</p>

<p>I hope the benevolence of the public will be extended to the sufferers in these
actions: some are piteous objects; indeed, no less than three brave men with the
loss of both arms.</p>

<p>I send this by a vessel belonging to Jersey.</p>
<p class="left60">My dear brother, most sincerely yours,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jas. Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>John Saumarez, Esq. Guernsey.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I am under great concern at the uneasiness you must all suffer at our
unsuccessful attack off Algeziras; but this will, I hope, soon remove it.
Messrs. Le Mesurier, jointly with Mr. Tucker, Lord St. Vincent's secretary, are
appointed agents.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>
<p>The following letter to Lady Saumarez is dated 17th July, on board the
C&aelig;sar, at Gibraltar; and gives a detailed account of his proceedings
after his arrival there.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Since our arrival here on Tuesday afternoon, every distinguished attention which
can be thought of has been paid to the squadron. The day following, the royal
standard was hoisted; at noon the garrison saluted; and, in the evening, the
most splendid illuminations took place in every habitable part of this famous
Rock. Yesterday the governor gave a dinner, and he intends to invite the ladies
to a ball on this occasion. We have, also, invitations from the different corps
for every day we are likely to remain here: but what has afforded me more
satisfaction, is the manner we were received after the attack of Algeziras,
which, from the arrival of the Spanish squadron, subjected the garrison to every
inconvenience of a port blockaded. The St. Antoine I have ordered to be
purchased into the service; and I propose to appoint officers to her. She is a
very good ship, and has suffered so little that I expect to have her fit for
service in less than a fortnight. The Spencer and Audacious I detached off Cape
St. Mary's, and I shall join them with the Pomp&eacute;e and Superb the first easterly
wind, and resume my station before Cadiz, where they cannot have more than four
ships ready for sea; and, I may venture to pronounce, the Spanish ships will not
come out, except the French take possession of the batteries and compel them. We
have almost daily accounts from thence, describing the disagreements between the
French and Spaniards as most serious. They also describe the two French ships as
being in a very shattered condition, and there being no materials in store to
repair them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p>I think my first accounts will reach you by way of Lisbon; but I hope Dumaresq,
with the subsequent ones, will make his appearance very soon after. I am very
impatient to hear from England. I require small vessels very much, as I have not
been able to convey the accounts of our success to Lord Keith.</p>

<p>When am I to hear from you? and when shall I be assured you have not suffered
from the relation of these events? The governor and others talk to me of honours
being conferred; but, unless Parliament furnish the means to support them with
dignity, I might as well be without them. The only ladies I have yet seen are,
Lady Ann Niel and Mrs. Edwards, whose husbands have regiments here; they are
very amiable people: besides, Mr. Fyers, whose daughter was married the evening
of the illumination,&mdash;an ominous day you will think. Captain Brenton will
draw you some excellent views of both actions, without partiality. I am most
highly indebted to him, in getting this ship so soon refitted, and, indeed,
throughout the whole of our important service. A large shot passed through the
cabin, which filled it with splinters, and demolished the tables and chairs,
besides the glass. Fortunately, my papers and wardrobe escaped. We are now quite
refitted; as well, I may say, as we were a fortnight ago.</p>

<p>I am in want of nothing whatever, but letters from you. Let me have favourable
accounts of yourself and of our precious children, and I shall be satisfied. I
hope to send a box of Malaga raisins for the young tribe. James will be
overjoyed to hear of his father's victory.</p></div>

<p>The following is the account of the above action, from the French
commander-in-chief, dated at Cadiz, 16th July 1801.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Citizen Minister.</span>&mdash;General Moreno has returned into harbour. General Linois
will give you an account of the sailing and passage of the squadron. I shall
only mention to you the chagrin which I have experienced at not seeing the
French ship, St. Antonio, and the two three-deckers, the Real Carlos and the
Hermenegildo: a marine, saved with forty-five men from the Real Carlos, has
informed us that about midnight the squadron having been attacked by the
English, the Real Carlos and the Hermenegildo took each other for enemies. A
very smart engagement ensued, the two vessels being nearly foul of each other. A
fire broke out on board the Real Carlos, which soon blew up, and set fire to the
Hermenegildo, which shared the same fate. The St. Antonio, in consequence of her
station, was near the latter vessel, and this station gave me the greatest
uneasiness; yet I have been assured that there were only two explosions. I have
reason to conclude that, to get at a distance from the conflagration, Captain
Lenny proceeded towards the coast of Africa, where the calms and currents
carried him away from the squadron, which, at the break of day, was six leagues
west of Cadiz. The day before yesterday the British ships were descried from the
coast, and a French ship in the Strait; but the latter did not appear to be
captured. This may give us some hope, if the signals are correct. Nothing
remains to me but uncertainty, with a great deal of fear; I do not know what
opinion to entertain.</p>

<p>After having spoken of our losses, it gives me great pleasure to state to you
the new glory with which Le Formidable, commanded by Captain Troude, has been
covered. During the night cannonade, in the middle of the Strait, this ship
received the fire of her friends and enemies; but with intrepid coolness the
captain would not return the fire, lest he should increase the disorder, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>keeping close to the Spanish coast, he retired from the combatants. He was
followed by a division of the British fleet of three ships, and a frigate: and,
at break of day, being in sight of Cadiz, and five leagues distant from the
squadron, he was attacked by three ships, with which he was engaged
half-an-hour, and obliged two of them to retire: the third endeavoured to attack
Le Formidable on the quarter, while the frigate cannonaded her in stern. But,
notwithstanding the bad state of his masts, Captain Troude approached within
musket-shot of the British ship, the Pomp&eacute;e, which, having lost her mast, after
an engagement of an hour and a half, made haste to get away, being taken in tow
by a frigate. Some time after, both of her masts came down, and the vessel had
the appearance of having yielded; but, as the two other ships and the frigate
were at a short distance, Captain Troude would not take possession of her: he
expected to be attacked again. The enemy, disconcerted both in their fire and
their bravery, suffered him quietly to pursue his course.</p>

<p>This engagement took place in sight of Cadiz; and the glorious result of a
combat so unequal, by covering our arms with glory, has filled the hearts of the
Spaniards with the utmost degree of enthusiasm. Le Formidable was scarcely
repaired after the battle of Algeziras, on the 6th,&mdash;top-gallant-mast
served as top-masts; but, in this damaged state, the brave Troude, instead of
flying from the enemy, who might have captured him without firing a shot,
offered them battle, as by this man&oelig;uvre, as prudent as bold, he first
extricated himself from two ships, which he greatly damaged, and at last totally
dismasted the Pomp&eacute;e,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> which fought him bravely for an hour and a half.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>
<p>The combined squadron was at that time becalmed, at the distance of five or six
leagues. I expected to see it, on the breeze springing up, come to take
possession of this vessel, and give chase to capture the four British ships
which were in sight; but I was far from having any idea of the misfortune which
befel the two three-deckers, which no doubt occasioned the separation of the St.
Antonio: and in the evening the squadron came to anchor.</p>

<p>Rear-admiral Linois was exceedingly sorry that he was not on board the
Formidable; but he did not think proper to resist the earnest solicitations of
General Moreno, who induced him to go on board his frigate that they might
better concert their operations. My respectful salutations,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Dumanoir le Pelley.</span></p></div>

<p>Report of Captain Troude, provisional commander of Le Formidable, to
Rear-admiral Linois:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">Cadiz, 15th July 1801.</p>
<p class="smcap">Citizen General,</p>

<p>I have the honour of communicating to you an account of the operations of Le
Formidable, with the provisional command of which you entrusted me. Proud of the
honourable charge of defending your flag, I endeavoured to execute your orders
with the most scrupulous exactness. I immediately repaired on board to assume
the chief command, and I put to sea as soon as you made the signal.</p>

<p>You observed, as well as myself, the movements of the enemy's squadron, which
had retired to Gibraltar after the memorable battle of the 6th at Algeziras.
Seeing the enemy set sail at the same time as the combined squadrons, and
keeping to windward of us at the distance of about a league, I endeavoured to
follow exactly your man&oelig;uvres, and made all the sail possible to follow
you; but the ship I had the honour to command, being absolutely disabled, having
only jury-masts and the lower sails, I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>could not make that way which I wished.
During the darkness of the night a strong breeze broke the small
top-gallant-mast that served me as a fore-top-mast, and everything contributed
to prevent me from following the combined squadron.</p>

<p>About midnight I sustained the fire of five English ships that had come up with
me: they fired red-hot bullets. I escaped as fast as possible from the brisk
cannonade which they maintained, hanging up the same lights as I observed them
to have. I had only three men killed, and two wounded. As I was very near the
combined squadron, I resolved not to engage, that I might avoid those fatal
mistakes which too often take place in a night engagement. I was afraid lest I
might fire into some of our own vessels, or that they might fire into mine; from
which, fatal accidents must have resulted to the combined squadron. At one in
the morning, not being able to observe or distinguish any more signals, I made
for Cadiz, keeping close in with the Spanish coast, on a course N. or N.E., and
by that means got at a distance from the squadron, which were steering large in
a westerly direction.</p>

<p>At break of day I found myself attacked by four of the enemy's
squadron,&mdash;three ships and a frigate,&mdash;which had pursued the same
course. Though totally disabled, and the crew fatigued, having had no rest for
three days, we returned their fire with courage: the frigate attacked us first,
but a few shots well directed from our stern-guns made her abandon her object.
The ship which followed, approached us, and kept up a brisk fire. We
man&oelig;uvred to get into a better position; I ran close to her until we were
yard-arm and yard-arm, and maintained a terrible and well-supported fire: after
being engaged an hour and a half, she was completely dismasted, making water in
every part. The frigate which had attacked me astern, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>came immediately to her
assistance; the other two vessels finding it necessary to sheer off after
receiving some broadsides, not without damage, joined the frigate, and hoisted
out all their boats to save the crew of the other vessel, and to take her in
tow. They resigned to me the field of battle, and retired.</p>

<p>I expected, however, another combat. We were determined to make the most
vigorous defence; but, as the enemy retired, and as I found myself in such a
situation as to be unable to pursue them, I resolved to proceed to Cadiz, where
I arrived at two in the afternoon.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to give you any account of particular instances of bravery.
The two staffs, the crew, and the troops who were passengers, vied with each
other,&mdash;covering themselves with glory; for, besides the noble combat of
the 6th, this proves that the valour which animated the brave men I have the
honour to command, was carried to a degree which it is difficult to describe.
Government will, no doubt, take the earliest opportunity of rewarding so much
courage, and so great a devotion to restore the glory of the French navy. It
would be just, also, to indemnify them for the losses they have sustained; their
effects having been cut to pieces and absolutely destroyed.</p>

<p>I have now, Citizen General, to communicate to you a very fatal
relation.&mdash;In the battle of this night, two of the ships which fired upon
me, took fire and blew up. I supposed them to be English, presuming that the
fire had been occasioned by the furnaces they had on board for heating their
shot; but, on entering the harbour of Cadiz, I was assured they were Spanish.
The darkness had led them into a mistake, which I had justly dreaded. They fired
on each other, and on my vessel, at the moment when I formed the prudent
resolution of avoiding a combat <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>in which I could not distinguish the enemy. The
names of these two vessels are the San Carlos and the Hermenegildo.</p>

<p>In the combat so severe as that of this morning, and against so unequal a force,

<p>Letter from Rear-admiral Linois to the Minister of the Marine, giving
an account of the action:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="smcap">Citizen Minister,</p>
<p>On the 9th of July a Spanish division, consisting of six sail of the line and
three frigates, arrived at Algeziras from Cadiz, under command of his Excellency
Lieutenant-general Moreno, in order to raise the blockade of four sail of the
line and one frigate, which were under my orders, and to favour their escape to
Cadiz. That officer accordingly gave me every assistance in his power in order
to put my ships in a condition to put to sea, and to tow them out, in order to
enable them to set sail. Our labour was continued day and night. General Moreno
made his squadron anchor in a line N.E. and S.W. On the 12th, there was a
tolerable fresh east wind, and it was determined to set sail at one o'clock in
the afternoon, on account of the tide. The signal being given at that hour, the
fleet set sail, the Spanish squadron being to windward of ours. The frigate
L'Indienne towed the Hannibal, which we were sorry to perceive made very little
way.</p>

<p>The calm which we experienced under Gibraltar necessarily deranged the
regularity of our order; while the enemy, having a brisk gale at east, sailed
from Gibraltar <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>with five sail of the line, a frigate, a brig, and a Portuguese
frigate, and formed the order of battle. As soon as the English Admiral had
passed Europa Point, he made a signal, and immediately we saw to windward six
sail, of which two had three masts. I was then with M. de Moreno on board the
Sabina frigate. At sunset, the two last ships of our line doubled the Cape
Carnero. Three only remained, with the Hannibal, which was under jury-masts, and
which consequently could not carry much sail.</p>

<p>Night was coming on, and it was necessary to return to our anchorage, which
afforded the enemy an opportunity of attacking us before we took a position. At
all events every delay was dangerous, for the reinforcements which the enemy
expected might arrive every moment. The breeze from the east becoming stronger,
we were assured of the wind during the night. We determined to send the Hannibal
back to Algeziras, and to pass the Strait with the combined squadron. We then
man&oelig;uvred so as to facilitate the rallying of two of our vessels, which
had fallen into the rear in consequence of the calm. The three French vessels,
which sailed better than could have been expected, were in the van; and in that
order it was proposed to pass the Strait.</p>

<p>At eight, the enemy showed a disposition to attack us. At nine we heard the
reports of three cannon, and at the same time we saw fires at a considerable
distance behind us. We presumed it might be some of the enemy's vessels making
signals of their arrival. We congratulated ourselves upon seeing our squadrons
so well collected together, and sailing so well, which made us confident that
the plan of the enemy would not succeed.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven the wind was considerably increased. The night was very
dark, and we heard a smart cannonade in the E.N.E.; and, soon after, we saw a
conflagration, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>which made us apprehend that some of our vessels, in firing
their stern guns, had taken fire, in consequence of the force of the wind. We
thought also that they might be fire-ships of the enemy. We put about for a
moment; but the vessel on fire approaching us, we continued our way, having
constantly a light at our main-top-mast head, as a signal for rallying.</p>

<p>It could no longer be doubted that the enemy had passed the Strait, and had got
into our wake. The cannonade became pretty general, but the wind was too strong
to continue the action. We received several shots on board the frigate, which
killed one man and wounded five. Several balls passed through our sails. We took
down the signal we had at our mast-head, for fear the enemy would fall upon us.
It was afterwards hoisted, in order to collect our ships. We made sail,
directing our course to the W.N.W., not choosing to go more before the wind,
lest the wind, which was very strong, would carry away our masts. We passed the
night in the greatest disquietude, not knowing whether the vessels which were in
sight were not enemies. At length the day dissipated part of our fears, and we
found ourselves in the midst of our fleet, with the exception of the two ships
of three decks, viz. the Hermenegildo and Real Carlos, and the Formidable and
the St. Antoine. The wind having fallen calm, it became impossible to go in
search of the vessels which had separated. We were then six leagues west of
Cadiz.</p>

<p>At half-past four the Dessaix made a signal that she had sprung a leak, and that
the water gained upon her thirty inches an hour. She demanded assistance, which
was granted. At five o'clock we heard an action in the east, and perceived a
smoke. The wind being then from the S.E., we made the signal for the line of
battle to be formed as quickly as possible, without regard to places, in order
to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>assist the vessel that was engaged. At half-past six the action ceased, and
a most perfect calm succeeded. At eleven, the wind rising again, we perceived
four vessels at a considerable distance from one another. We flattered ourselves
at first that they were our ships, but we soon found by their man&oelig;uvres
that they were enemies. We also distinguished the Formidable close under the
land, making the best of her way to Cadiz. We stood for the port, from which a
felucca brought me a letter from the captain of the Formidable, which had been
anchored in the Road of Cadiz, stating that in the morning he had engaged two
ships of the line and a frigate, and that one of the ships of the line had been
completely dismasted, and had been towed away by a frigate. We then anchored in
Cadiz.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge the consummate experience and talents of General Moreno, as
well as the zeal and care which he displayed for the success of his mission. If
separations have taken place, they must be attributed to the darkness of the
night, and the necessity which there was of getting away from the vessels that
were on fire. That officer, on hearing at Cadiz of the destruction of two ships
of his squadron, Hermenegildo and Real-Carlos, was justly struck with grief on
the occasion. He had, by his wise instructions, provided against almost every
possible case. I have since been informed that the two Spanish vessels which
were destroyed, cannonaded and run foul of one another, each supposing the other
to be an enemy. We are uncertain about the fate of the St. Antoine. The violence
of the wind made it extremely dangerous to fire to windward.</p>

<p>Admiral Moreno's orders to his fleet on the 11th July 1801:</p></div>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Orders of sailing to be observed by the ships in my charge on their passage
through the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The three ships under the command of Rear-admiral Linois will form the vanguard,
with the line abreast; the six ships under my charge will form astern of these,
likewise formed in a line abreast, endeavouring, as much as possible, to keep
opposite to the intervals of the French ships, so as not to impede their fire,
according to the following disposition:</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<table cellspacing="10" summary="Vanguard">

<td>R. Carlos.&nbsp; Hermenegildo.</td>
<td>St. Antonio.&nbsp; St. Fernando.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p>In case the enemy should attempt to follow and attack the combined squadron in
the rear, besides the continual fire which we ought to make from the stern
chasers, chiefly with a view to destroy the enemy's rigging, the squadron will
form the line ahead, either with their heads to the Spanish coast, or to that of
Africa, as will be determined by signal from the Admiral; and, in order that
this might be more simple, in that case, he will only show the signal for the
course, at the entire lowering of which the movements must be made. As their
situation, from their local position, cannot be of long duration, consequently
either by hailing (if near enough) or by signal to preserve the course, the
squadron will proceed again to form the line abreast as formerly. It is of the
utmost importance that the fire from none of the ships should interfere, or be
embarrassed with that of others in this squadron, nor leave the three French
ships in the rear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the French ships get under sail, all those in my charge will do the
same, following the track of each other, always observing to keep at a short
distance from the French, till we weather the Point of Carnero, in order that if
the enemy should get under sail, and find themselves in a situation to offer
battle to our squadron before it is formed in the Straits with the line abreast
as above directed, we may engage them with advantage; consequently, the least
inattention or delay may produce the most unfortunate consequences.</p>

<p>I think the captains of the ships I have the honour to command are fully
persuaded of this truth, and therefore I depend upon its efficacy; and I flatter
myself that they are convinced everything will be performed on my part which can
be inspired by my wish to add to the glory of his Majesty's arms, that of our
corps in particular, and the nation in general.</p>

<p>To those conversant in naval affairs, it must appear manifest that the
disposition made by Admirals Moreno and Linois was one of the worst
that could be devised. It was scarcely possible that nine ships, which
had never sailed in company with each other, could maintain, for any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
length of time, a line abreast before the wind so exactly as to be
able to form in a line ahead when required, especially in a dark night
with a strong breeze; and it must be evident that any ship which
advanced at all ahead of the others could never get into the line of
battle when the signal was made to form it on either tack. Moreno
seems to have been fully aware of the probability of the ships firing
into each other, yet he made arrangements of all others the least
likely to prevent it. Had he formed into two lines ahead, with the
disabled ships in advance, he would have obviated the risk of firing
into each other, while the one division, by shortening sail, might
have given timely assistance to the other which had been attacked.</p>

<p>Nothing can equal the scene of horror which the sudden conflagration
produced in these two ships. The collision in which the fore-top-mast
of the Hermenegildo fell on board of the Real Carlos, added to the
general dismay; and the agonising screams of the unhappy crews,
deserted by their countrymen and allies in that dreadful hour, could
not fail to pierce the hearts of the brave conquerors; but to render
them any assistance while the hostile flag was flying was impossible.
The duty of the Admiral was to "sink, burn, and destroy." Seven sail
of the enemy's line were still flying from half their force, and he
was obliged to leave the burning ships to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> fate, and pursue his
enemy until his destruction was complete.</p>

<p>The capture of the Hannibal, in which the Spaniards had so
distinguished a share, induced a number of the young men of family to
embark in the two Spanish three-deckers, in order to convey their
trophy to Cadiz, never supposing that the half-demolished British
squadron would dare to approach so formidable and so superior a force.
This fatal event, while it plunged into distress the whole city of
Cadiz, could not fail to create a sensation strongly unfavourable to
their new republican allies as the originators of their misery.</p>

When the action had ceased, Sir Hyde Parker, captain of the Latona
and son of the admiral, bore down on the Fortitude, and affectionately inquired
for his brave parent, of whose gallantry he had been an anxious eye-witness. The
admiral, with equal warmth, assured his son of his personal safety, and spoke of
his mortification at being unable, from the state of his own ship, and from the
reports he had received of the other ships, to pursue the advantage he had
gained, in the manner he most ardently desired.</p>

In allusion to this memorable event, Sir James writes&mdash;"When
on the morning of the 1st of August the reconnoitring ship made the signal that
the enemy was not there, despondency nearly took possession of my mind, and I do
not recollect ever to have felt so utterly hopeless, or out of spirits, as when
we sat down to dinner; judge then what a change took place when, as the cloth
was being removed, the officer of the watch hastily came in, saying&mdash;'Sir,
a signal is just now made that the enemy is in Aboukir Bay, and moored in a line
of battle.' All sprang from their seats, and only staying to drink a <span class="italic">bumper</span> to
our success, we were in a moment on deck." On his appearance there his brave
men, animated by one spirit, gave three hearty cheers, in token of their joy at
having at length found their long-looked-for enemy, without the possibility of
his again eluding their pursuit.</p>

We may here state that, on the preceding day, Captain Ball had
paid a visit to Sir James; and as they were discussing the various points of the
battle, he stated to Sir James, that "having been the second in command, he
would, unquestionably, receive some mark of distinction on the occasion."
Saumarez, in the enthusiasm of the moment, exclaimed, "We all did our
duty,&mdash;there was no second in command!" meaning, of course, that he did not
consider he had done more than other captains; and, not supposing that this
observation would come to the ears of the Admiral. But, he afterwards thought,
Nelson had availed himself of this conversation, to deprive him of the advantage
to which his seniority entitled him, although he fully exonerated Captain Ball
of having the slightest intention of communicating to the Admiral anything he
could have supposed would be detrimental to his interest.</p>

Sir James displayed a remarkable instance of presence of mind and
unhesitating decision in this unexpected case of extreme danger. Captain John
Tancock, who was then lieutenant of the watch, and who, having served under Sir
James during the whole of the war, enjoyed his perfect confidence, anticipated
the captain's wishes in volunteering on this occasion to go up to the mast-head
and look out for rocks, and thus considerably relieved his anxiety. The prizes
were quite unable to beat to windward, and, in order to be extricated from the
peril which the shift of wind had occasioned, their signal was made "to keep in
the Orion's wake." Sir James having determined to push on, as the most probable
means of saving his inefficient squadron, the "helm was put up," and orders
given to steer through a passage between islands, which was marked "<span class="italic">doubtful</span>" in
the charts, and in which shallow water was soon discovered by Mr. Tancock, who
gave timely notice to the helmsman on their approach to each danger. The rest of
the ships kept close in the track of the Orion, and in this manner the whole of
the squadron and prizes passed between the islands and breakers without
accident; and there can be no doubt that their safety was owing to the skilful
and decisive conduct of Sir James. It is but justice to add, that, in approving
of Mr. Tancock's very meritorious conduct, he emphatically assured him that "he
should never forget that he had so fully anticipated his wishes."</p>

<p class="right">Vanguard, September 1st, 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Sir,</p>

<p>From what I have heard, and made up in my own mind, I feel it is absolutely
necessary that I should order the Minotaur and Audacious to quit your squadron
when you are in the fair way between Sardinia and Minorca, and join me at
Naples; and also with as much salt provisions as can be got out of the ships
victualled for <span class="italic">six</span> months, reserving only one month's at whole allowance. My
squadron are at two-thirds of salt provisions, making the allowance up with
flour; therefore you will direct the same in yours. I have put down the number
of casks of beef, pork, and pease, which can be easily spared if the
commander-in-chief's orders for victualling have been obeyed. Audacious is, I
fancy, short of salt provisions, not knowing of coming so long a voyage. If you
can manage to let those ships have any part of their officers and men, it will
be very useful for the King's service; but of this you must be the best judge.
Retalick will tell you all the news from Rhodes, and I was rejoiced to see you
are this side of Candia.</p>

<p class="left70">Ever yours most truly,<br /></p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson.</span></p>
<p>To Sir James Saumarez, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Your squadron evidently sails better than Culloden. The Bellerophon sails so
well that Darby can take very good care of Conqu&eacute;rant; and Aquilon seems also to
sail remarkably well. Remember me kindly to all my good friends with you.</p>
<hr class="p2 c15"  />
<p class="p2 right">Orion, at sea, 1st September.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>Captain Retalick has just joined me with your order respecting the Minotaur and
Audacious, both which ships are to be detached for Naples so soon as we are in
the fair way between Sardinia and Minorca, with as much salt provisions as can
be spared from the ships victualled for six months; which shall be duly complied
with. I shall also take from the prizes as many of the officers and men as can
be replaced from the ships left with me, which I shall endeavour to be as near
the full number as can be thought prudent. Wishing to use as little delay as
possible, not to detain the Bonne Citoyenne,</p>

<p class="left75">I am very truly, &amp;c.<br /></p>

<p class="p2 right">Orion, at sea, 1st September.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>After contending for three days against the adverse winds which are almost
invariably encountered here, and getting sufficiently to the northward to have
weathered the small islands that lie more immediately between the Archipelago
and Candia, the wind set in so strong to the westward Thursday morning, that I
was compelled to desist from that passage, and bear up between Sargeanto and
Guxo, a narrow and intricate channel; but which we happily cleared without any
accident, the loss of a few spars excepted, which are now replaced; and we are
proceeding as fast as the wind will admit to our destination. The ships are all
doing as well as possible; the fever on board the Defence fast abating, and the
wounded in Bellerophon, Majestic, and Minotaur daily recovering. Seeing the
Citoyenne on her way to us, I seize the opportunity to give you the information.</p>

<p class="left70">I am, my dear sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James Saumarez.</span></p>
<p>To Sir H. Nelson, K.B.</p>

<hr class="p2 c15" />
<p class="p2 right">Orion, at sea, 5th Sept. 1798.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>Since the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, containing an order for the
Minotaur and Audacious to join you at Naples, I have been employed in making the
necessary arrangements for the distribution of prisoners from the ships that
remain with me. I fear the quantity that can be spared, after reducing ourselves
to four weeks at whole allowance, will fall very short of what you mention. The
order for the ships to be put to two-thirds' allowance was given the day after I
received your letter. With regard to the men belonging to the Minotaur and
Audacious on board the prizes, I hope to have it in my power to meet more fully
your expectations, as I see no reason why these men should not be almost
entirely replaced from the ships with me, the Bellerophon and Majestic having
only fifty men each on board; the Spartiate certainly can spare the same number
for Le Conqu&eacute;rant; and I hope to man the Aquilon from the other three ships,
except the party of marines, which I shall direct to be left on board of them.
We have had favourable winds the last three days, and I hope to-morrow to get
sight of Mount &AElig;tna. The enclosed report of a vessel boarded by the Theseus
makes me regret the wind did not prove favourable a few days sooner, to have
come up with the strayed sheep.</p>

<p class="right">10 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Captain Renhouse, in the Thalia, has this instant joined me on his return from
Bequir. I have taken his letters for the fleet, &amp;c.: and as the Flora cutter
is in sight, closing with the squadron, I have detained him till the morning,
that he may take from her any despatches she may have for you. I am happy to
learn from him that the Lion had joined the squadron off Alexandria. He also
informs me that the Marquis de Niza was on his return from Aboukir, highly
mortified at having lost the opportunity of distinguishing himself in the
action. I am truly, my dear Admiral,</p>

<p class="left55">Your faithful and most obedient servant,</p>

<hr class="p2 c15" />
<p class="p2 right">Orion, 6th September 1798.<br />
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> 7 o'clock.</p>
<p class="smcap">My dear Admiral,</p>

<p>The Flora did not join me till this instant, owing to the commander's timidity.
I was waiting for him the whole night. I thought it my duty to open one of Earl
St. Vincent's public despatches, in case they might contain anything that might
render necessary any alteration in my present proceedings. I find from them that
Colossus is to the southward of Sardinia, with the Alliance and four
victuallers: we shall of course keep a look-out for them. This information will
enable me to keep rather a greater supply of provisions than I had made
arrangements for, having scarcely reserved four weeks to each ship of the
squadron. I have charged Captain Newhouse with the Flora's despatches, with
orders to proceed in search of you immediately, and also indicated to him the
track I mean to pursue, in case you should have occasion to send me further
orders, in consequence of your letters from Earl St. Vincent.</p>

<p>I hope you will do me the favour to believe that I have acted to the best of my
judgment for the good of his Majesty's service, and that you will approve my
having opened one of Lord St. Vincent's public despatches; which it will be
satisfactory to me to know from you.</p>

<p>If the Rear-admiral finds the enemy's ships in a situation to be
attacked, the following is the order in which it is to be executed:</p>

<p>The Venerable to lead into the bay, and pass the enemy's ships without
anchoring;</p>

<p>The Pomp&eacute;e to anchor abreast of the inner ship of the enemy's line;</p>

When the French happen to take one of our men-of-war, they do not,
as we would do, hoist their own colours over their opponents', but hoist the
English ensign union downwards. It so seldom happened that an English man-of-war
was taken by the French, that this circumstance was known to very few in the
navy, and consequently, the ensign reversed was known only as the signal of
distress used by merchant-ships.</p>

The discrepancies between the diagram and <span class="italic">some</span> of the statements
given in the logs, are easily accounted for by the changes which took place in
the positions of the ships during the action.</p>

The journal of Lieutenant Collis of the Venerable, the officer who
was sent to assist the Hannibal, and was taken prisoner when on board, but who
was sent to Gibraltar on parole, need not be given, as it is an exact copy of
the captain's log.</p>

This was a gratuitous falsehood.</p>

While off Europa point, and probably at the distance of more than
half a mile, a boat with two men was observed pulling towards us, and, on coming
alongside, the men proved to be two of our own people, who had been wounded in
the action of Algeziras, and sent to the hospital at Gibraltar. On seeing the
ship under sail, with the evident intention of attacking the enemy, these
gallant fellows asked permission of the surgeon to rejoin their ship, and being
refused, on account of their apparent unfitness, they made their escape from the
hospital, and taking possession of the first boat they could find, pulled off to
the ship.</p>

<p>Two other seamen belonging to the Pomp&eacute;e, who had not been selected as part of
the reinforcement to the crews of the other ships, secreted themselves on board
the C&aelig;sar, and the day after the action presented themselves on the
quarter-deck, with a request that intercession might be made for them with their
captain, telling their story in the following quaint manner:&mdash;"Sir, we
belongs to the Le Pomp&eacute;e, and finding our ship could not get out, we stowed
ourselves away in this ship, and, in the action, quartered ourselves to the
"10th gun, and opposite&mdash;&mdash; on the lower deck," referring, at the same
time, to the officer in command of this division of guns, for the truth of their
statement.</p>

M. Dumanoir le Pelley is in error here. The Pomp&eacute;e was not in this
action. It has been seen that she was lying disabled at Gibraltar.</p></div>
